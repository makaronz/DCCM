# 6.3 Mapping to HDR

"Mapping to HDR" generally refers to the process of converting existing Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content to High Dynamic Range (HDR). This is distinct from *grading native HDR content*, which is captured with an HDR camera and workflow. Mapping SDR to HDR is a complex process that involves expanding the dynamic range and color gamut of the original content, and it's often more of an *interpretation* than a precise conversion. There's no single "correct" way to do it, and the results can vary significantly depending on the techniques used and the artistic choices made.

## Challenges of Mapping SDR to HDR

*   **Limited Source Information:** SDR content has a limited dynamic range and color gamut compared to HDR. This means that there's simply less information to work with. You can't create detail in highlights or shadows that wasn't captured in the first place.
*   **Clipping and Crushing:** SDR content may have clipped highlights (areas that are pure white) or crushed shadows (areas that are pure black). These areas contain no detail, and it's impossible to recover that lost information.
*   **Color Gamut Limitations:** SDR content is typically captured and displayed in the Rec. 709 color space, which is much smaller than the Rec. 2020 color space commonly used for HDR. Expanding the color gamut can be challenging and may lead to inaccurate or unnatural-looking colors.
* **Artistic Interpretation:** Mapping SDR to HDR is inherently an interpretive process. There's no single "correct" way to expand the dynamic range and color gamut. The results will depend on the specific techniques used and the artistic choices made by the colorist or engineer.

## Techniques for Mapping SDR to HDR

Several techniques can be used to map SDR content to HDR, ranging from simple automated processes to complex manual grading.

*   **Inverse Tone Mapping (Automated):** Some software and hardware solutions offer automated inverse tone mapping algorithms. These algorithms attempt to expand the dynamic range of the SDR content by analyzing the image and making educated guesses about how to redistribute the luminance values. The results can vary in quality, and often require manual adjustments.
*   **Manual Grading:** This involves using color grading software (like DaVinci Resolve, Baselight, or FilmLight) to manually adjust the luminance and color values of the SDR content. This approach provides the most control, but it's also the most time-consuming and requires significant skill and experience.
*   **AI-Powered Upscaling/Remastering:** Some newer tools utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze and enhance SDR content, potentially improving the results of HDR conversion.
* **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining automated inverse tone mapping with manual grading can often produce the best results. The automated process can provide a starting point, and then the colorist can make manual adjustments to refine the image and address any artifacts.

## Steps for Manual Grading (SDR to HDR)

1.  **Analyze the Source Material:** Carefully examine the SDR content to identify any limitations, such as clipped highlights, crushed shadows, or color banding.
2.  **Set up a Color-Managed Workflow:** Use a color-managed workflow (e.g., ACES or DaVinci Resolve Color Management) to ensure accurate color representation throughout the process.
3.  **Expand the Dynamic Range:** Use curves, levels, or other grading tools to carefully expand the dynamic range of the image. Avoid pushing the highlights too far, as this can lead to unnatural-looking results. Focus on bringing out detail in the midtones and shadows, while preserving a natural-looking contrast.
4.  **Adjust the Color Gamut:** If necessary, expand the color gamut of the image. Be careful not to oversaturate the colors or introduce artifacts.
5.  **Refine the Image:** Make any necessary adjustments to the overall contrast, color balance, and sharpness of the image.
6.  **Target a Specific HDR Standard:** When mapping SDR to HDR, it's important to target a specific HDR standard (e.g., HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG). This will determine the appropriate transfer function (PQ or HLG) and color gamut (typically Rec. 2020).
7. **Monitor on an HDR Display:** Grade the content on a calibrated HDR display that meets the requirements of the target HDR standard.
8. **Quality Control:** Perform a quality control (QC) check on a variety of HDR displays to ensure that the content looks as intended.

## Considerations

*   **Content Suitability:** Not all SDR content is suitable for mapping to HDR. Content with significant clipping, crushing, or banding may not produce good results.
*   **Artistic Intent:** Consider the original artistic intent of the SDR content. Avoid making changes that drastically alter the look and feel of the original.
*   **Expectations:** Manage expectations. Mapping SDR to HDR can improve the image quality, but it won't magically transform SDR content into true HDR. The results will always be limited by the quality of the original source material.

Mapping SDR to HDR is a complex process that requires careful consideration and skillful execution. While it can enhance the viewing experience, it's important to understand its limitations and to approach it with realistic expectations.
