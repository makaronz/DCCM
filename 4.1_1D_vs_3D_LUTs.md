# 4.1 1D vs. 3D LUTs

LUTs (Lookup Tables) are essential tools in color management and color grading. They are essentially pre-calculated tables that map input color values to output color values, allowing for efficient and consistent color transformations. There are two main types of LUTs: 1D LUTs and 3D LUTs.

## 1D LUTs

*   **Definition:** A 1D LUT (one-dimensional lookup table) applies a transformation independently to each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue).  It maps input values for each channel to corresponding output values.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Affects Contrast and Gamma:** 1D LUTs primarily affect the overall contrast and gamma of the image. They can be used to adjust brightness, contrast, and the tonal response curve.
    *   **Cannot Affect Hue or Saturation Independently:**  Because 1D LUTs operate on each channel separately, they cannot change the hue or saturation of a color *without* also affecting its luminance. For example, you can't use a 1D LUT to make a red color more saturated without also making it brighter or darker.
    *   **Simple and Efficient:** 1D LUTs are computationally simple and efficient.
    *   **Structure:** A 1D LUT is simply a table with a list of input values and corresponding output values for each color channel. For example, in an 8-bit system, a 1D LUT would have 256 entries for each channel (Red, Green, Blue).

*   **Example:** A 1D LUT might be used to convert linear footage to a specific gamma curve (e.g., Rec.709 gamma).

## 3D LUTs

*   **Definition:** A 3D LUT (three-dimensional lookup table) applies a transformation to the entire RGB color space *as a whole*.  It maps input RGB *triplets* (combinations of Red, Green, and Blue values) to output RGB triplets.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Affects Hue, Saturation, and Luminance:** 3D LUTs can affect all three aspects of color: hue, saturation, and luminance. They can be used to perform complex color transformations, such as changing the overall color palette of an image or emulating the look of a specific film stock.
    *   **More Powerful and Flexible than 1D LUTs:** 3D LUTs offer much more control over color than 1D LUTs.
    *   **More Computationally Intensive:** 3D LUTs are more complex than 1D LUTs and require more processing power.
    *   **Structure:** A 3D LUT can be visualized as a cube. Each point within the cube represents a specific RGB color. The location of the point within the cube determines its input color, and the color of the point itself represents the output color.  The size of the cube determines the precision of the LUT. Common sizes include 17x17x17, 33x33x33, and 65x65x65.  A larger cube provides more granularity and accuracy, but also requires more memory and processing power.

*   **Example:** A 3D LUT might be used to convert Log C footage to Rec.709, or to apply a creative "look" to an image.

## Choosing Between 1D and 3D LUTs

*   **Use a 1D LUT when:**
    *   You only need to adjust the overall contrast and gamma of the image.
    *   You need a simple and efficient transformation.
    *   You're working in a system with limited processing power.

*   **Use a 3D LUT when:**
    *   You need to make complex color transformations that affect hue, saturation, and luminance.
    *   You need to convert between different color spaces (e.g., Log to Rec.709).
    *   You need to apply a creative "look" to the image.
    *   You're working in a professional color grading environment.

In many cases, a combination of 1D and 3D LUTs may be used. For example, a 1D LUT might be used for initial gamma correction, followed by a 3D LUT for color space conversion and creative grading.
