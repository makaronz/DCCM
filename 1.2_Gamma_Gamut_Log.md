# 1.2 Gamma, Gamut, and Logarithmic Encoding

## Gamma Curves

Gamma curves define the relationship between the input signal (light intensity from the scene) and the output signal (the pixel value recorded by the camera or displayed on a screen).  They are crucial for how we perceive brightness and contrast in images.  A linear relationship (gamma = 1) would mean that doubling the light intensity doubles the pixel value. However, human vision doesn't perceive brightness linearly. We are more sensitive to changes in darker tones than in brighter tones.

*   **Power Functions:** The most basic form of a gamma curve is a power function:

    `Output = Input ^ γ`

    Where:

    *   `Input` is the normalized light intensity (ranging from 0 to 1).
    *   `Output` is the normalized pixel value (also ranging from 0 to 1).
    *   `γ` (gamma) is the exponent that determines the shape of the curve.

    A gamma value less than 1 results in a curve that brightens the image, making darker tones more visible. A gamma value greater than 1 darkens the image.

    Historically, CRT (cathode ray tube) displays had a non-linear response with a gamma of around 2.2.  To compensate for this, images were often encoded with a gamma of approximately 1/2.2 (around 0.45). This ensured that the final image, when displayed on a CRT, would appear with the correct brightness and contrast.  This "display gamma" of 2.2 has become a standard, even with modern LCD and OLED displays.

* **Log Functions:** Logarithmic encoding is a different approach to mapping scene luminance to code values. Instead of a power function, it uses a logarithmic function. Logarithmic curves are particularly useful for capturing scenes with a very wide dynamic range (a large difference between the brightest and darkest parts of the scene).

    Log encoding mimics the logarithmic response of human vision.  Our eyes are much better at distinguishing subtle differences in dark tones than in bright tones.  Log encoding allocates more code values to the darker parts of the image, preserving detail in the shadows, and fewer code values to the brighter parts, where we are less sensitive to changes.

    The specific mathematical formulas for log encoding vary between camera manufacturers (e.g., ARRI Log C, Sony S-Log3, RED Log3G10). However, they generally share these characteristics:

    *   A logarithmic curve for the midtones and highlights.
    *   A linear segment in the shadows (often called a "toe") to control noise and provide a smooth transition to black.
    *   Parameters that control the slope and shape of the curve.

## Color Gamuts

A color gamut defines the range of colors that a device can capture (e.g., a camera sensor) or display (e.g., a monitor or projector).  It's essentially a subset of all visible colors.  Gamuts are often represented as a triangle within the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, which is a two-dimensional representation of the CIE XYZ color space.

*   **Rec.709:** This is the standard color gamut for high-definition television (HDTV). It's a relatively small gamut, covering a limited range of colors.
*   **DCI-P3:** This is a wider color gamut used for digital cinema projection. It covers a larger range of colors than Rec.709, particularly in the greens and reds.
*   **Rec.2020:** This is a very wide color gamut intended for ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV) and high dynamic range (HDR) content. It covers a significantly larger range of colors than both Rec.709 and DCI-P3.  It's closer to the full range of human vision, but current display technology cannot fully reproduce it.
*   **Mathematical Representation:**  Gamuts are defined by the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of their primary colors (red, green, and blue) within the CIE xy chromaticity diagram.  These coordinates specify the exact hue and saturation of each primary. The white point of the gamut is also defined by its chromaticity coordinates.

## Log Encoding

Log encoding, as mentioned earlier, is a method of encoding image data to capture a wider dynamic range.  It's particularly important in digital cinema, where scenes often have very high contrast.

*   **Benefits of Log Encoding:**
    *   **Preserves Highlight and Shadow Detail:**  By compressing the tonal range, log encoding prevents highlights from clipping (becoming pure white) and shadows from crushing (becoming pure black).
    *   **Provides More Flexibility in Grading:**  Log footage has a "flat" or "washed-out" appearance initially, but it contains more information than standard gamma-encoded footage. This gives the colorist more latitude to adjust the contrast and color during post-production.
    *   **Reduces Banding:** By allocating more code values to the darker tones, log encoding can help reduce banding artifacts in gradients.

*   **Relationship to Linear Data:** Log encoding is a non-linear transformation of the linear light data captured by the sensor.  To view log footage correctly, it must be transformed back to a display-referred color space (like Rec.709) using a LUT (Lookup Table) or a color transform.

* **Common Log Encodings:**
    * **ARRI Log C:** Used by ARRI cameras (ALEXA, AMIRA).
    * **Sony S-Log3:** Used by Sony cameras (VENICE, F65, F55, etc.).
    * **RED Log3G10:** Used by RED cameras (RED ONE, EPIC, SCARLET, DRAGON, etc.).
    * **Canon Log:** Used by Canon Cinema EOS cameras.
    * **Panasonic V-Log:** Used by Panasonic VariCam cameras.
    * **Blackmagic Design Film:** Used by Blackmagic Design cameras.

Each of these log encodings has its own specific characteristics, but they all serve the same fundamental purpose: to capture a wider dynamic range and provide more flexibility in post-production.
