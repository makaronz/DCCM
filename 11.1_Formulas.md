# 11.1 Formulas (Appendix)

This appendix provides a collection of formulas and mathematical representations relevant to color management in digital cinema. Note that some of these formulas are simplified representations and the exact implementations may vary between manufacturers and software. Refer to official documentation and white papers for precise details.

## Gamma Curves

*   **Basic Power Function:**

    `Output = Input ^ γ`

    Where:

    *   `Input` is the normalized input value (0-1).
    *   `Output` is the normalized output value (0-1).
    *   `γ` (gamma) is the exponent.

*   **Rec. 709 Transfer Function (Simplified):**

    The overall transfer function is close to a gamma of 2.4, but it has a linear segment near black. The official transfer function is defined in BT.1886, but a common approximation is:

    ```
    if (Input <= 0.018) {
      Output = 4.5 * Input;
    } else {
      Output = 1.099 * Input^0.45 - 0.099;
    }
    ```
## Logarithmic Encodings (Simplified Examples)

* **ARRI Log C (Simplified):**

    ```
    if (x <= a) {
      y = m * x + b;  // Linear segment (toe)
    } else {
      y = c * log(x) + d; // Logarithmic segment
    }
    ```

    Where:

    *   `x` is the normalized linear scene luminance.
    *   `y` is the encoded code value.
    *   `a` is the breakpoint between the linear and logarithmic segments.
    *   `m` and `b` are the slope and offset of the linear segment.
    *   `c` and `d` are parameters that control the shape and position of the logarithmic segment.

    (The actual Log C formula is more complex and proprietary to ARRI.)

*   **Sony S-Log3 (Simplified):**

    ```
    if (x <= a){
        y = m*x + b
    }
    else{
        y = c * log10(x + offset) + d
    }
    ```
     (The actual S-Log3 formula is proprietary to Sony.)

*   **RED Log3G10 (Simplified):**

    `y = log10(x * 10) * c + d`

    (The actual Log3G10 formula is proprietary to RED.)

## CIE XYZ Color Space

*   **RGB to XYZ Transformation (General Form):**

    ```
    [X]   [ Rx  Gx  Bx ] [R]
    [Y] = [ Ry  Gy  By ] [G]
    [Z]   [ Rz  Gz  Bz ] [B]
    ```

    Where:

    *   R, G, B are the *linear* RGB values.
    *   X, Y, Z are the CIE XYZ values.
    *   Rx, Ry, Rz, Gx, Gy, Gz, Bx, By, Bz are the elements of the transformation matrix (specific to each RGB color space).

* **XYZ to RGB (Inverse Transformation):** Uses the inverse of the matrix above.

## ACES Transforms (Simplified)

ACES uses a series of transforms to convert between camera native color spaces and display color spaces. These transforms are often implemented using matrix multiplications and LUTs. The exact matrices and LUTs are defined by the Academy and are available in their documentation and within software that supports ACES.

* **IDT (Input Device Transform):** Transforms camera native data (Log or RAW) to ACES2065-1.  These are specific to each camera and recording format.

* **RRT (Reference Rendering Transform):** A conceptual transform that converts scene-referred ACES2065-1 to a standard display-referred representation. The RRT is effectively built into the ODTs.

* **ODT (Output Device Transform):** Transforms from ACES (typically ACEScct) to a specific display color space (e.g., Rec.709, DCI-P3).

## PQ (Perceptual Quantizer) Transfer Function (Simplified)

```
L = ( (c1 + c2 * Y^m1) / (1 + c3 * Y^m1) ) ^ m2
```

Where:

*   `L` is the absolute luminance in nits.
*   `Y` is the normalized code value (ranging from 0 to 1).
*   `m1`, `m2`, `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` are constants defined in the SMPTE ST 2084 standard.

## HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) Transfer Function (Simplified)

```
if (Y <= 0.5) {
  L = Y ^ γ;  // Gamma curve (similar to Rec. 709)
} else {
  L = a * ln(Y - b) + c; // Logarithmic curve
}
```

Where:

*   `L` is the relative luminance.
*   `Y` is the normalized code value.
*   `γ`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants defined in the ARIB STD-B67 standard.

## Interpolation Methods

### Interpolacja trójliniowa (Trilinear Interpolation)
```
C_out = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)C_000 + 
        x(1 - y)(1 - z)C_100 + 
        (1 - x)y(1 - z)C_010 + 
        xy(1 - z)C_110 + 
        (1 - x)(1 - y)zC_001 + 
        x(1 - y)zC_101 + 
        (1 - x)yzC_011 + 
        xyzC_111
```

### Interpolacja tetrahedralna (Tetrahedral Interpolation)
```
C_out = ∑(w_i * C_i)
gdzie:
w_i = objętość pod-tetraedru przeciwna do wierzchołka i
C_i = wartość koloru w wierzchołku i
```

**Important Notes:**

*   These formulas are simplified representations for illustrative purposes. The exact formulas used in practice are often more complex and may be proprietary to camera manufacturers or standards organizations.
*   Always refer to the official documentation and white papers from the relevant manufacturers and organizations (e.g., ARRI, Sony, RED, SMPTE, ITU, Academy) for precise and up-to-date information.
* Many of these transforms are implemented within software like DaVinci Resolve, Baselight, and other color grading and compositing applications, so you don't typically need to perform these calculations manually. However, understanding the underlying principles is crucial for effective color management.
