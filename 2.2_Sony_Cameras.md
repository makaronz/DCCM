# 2.2 Sony Cameras (VENICE, VENICE 2, BURANO)

## Sensor Specs

Sony's digital cinema cameras, particularly the VENICE series, are known for their full-frame sensors, wide dynamic range, and excellent low-light performance.

*   **Sony VENICE:** The original VENICE features a 36x24mm full-frame sensor with a dual-base ISO of 500 and 2500.  Dual-base ISO means the camera has two distinct sensitivity settings with optimized circuitry for each, allowing for cleaner images at both lower and higher ISO values.  The VENICE has a claimed dynamic range of 15+ stops.
*   **Sony VENICE 2:** The VENICE 2 offers two sensor options: an 8.6K sensor and the original 6K VENICE sensor. The 8.6K sensor has a dual-base ISO of 800 and 3200, while the 6K sensor retains the 500/2500 dual-base ISO. The VENICE 2 also boasts improved color science and internal recording options.
* **Sony BURANO:** The BURANO is designed as a more compact and versatile camera, bridging the gap between Sony's cinema line and their mirrorless cameras. It features an 8.6K full-frame sensor, similar to the VENICE 2, but in a smaller body. It's optimized for single-operator use and run-and-gun productions.

Sony's sensors use a color filter array (CFA) designed for accurate color separation and reproduction. The specific details of the CFA are proprietary, but Sony emphasizes the wide color gamut and accurate color rendition of their cameras.

## S-Gamut Variations & S-Log3

Sony uses its own set of color spaces and logarithmic encoding for its cinema cameras.

*   **S-Gamut:** S-Gamut is Sony's family of wide color gamuts.  There are several variations:
    *   **S-Gamut3:**  A very wide gamut, exceeding Rec.2020. It's designed to capture the maximum range of colors possible with the sensor.
    *   **S-Gamut3.Cine:** A slightly smaller gamut than S-Gamut3, designed to be easier to grade and manage in post-production. It's still wider than DCI-P3.
    * **Original S-Gamut:** The original S-Gamut is no longer recommended.

*   **S-Log3:** S-Log3 is Sony's logarithmic encoding, designed to capture the wide dynamic range of their sensors. It's similar in principle to ARRI's Log C, but with a different curve shape and characteristics. S-Log3 is designed to be used with S-Gamut3 or S-Gamut3.Cine.

S-Log3 and S-Gamut3/S-Gamut3.Cine work together to provide a wide dynamic range and color gamut, offering significant flexibility in post-production.

## Codec Options

Sony cameras offer a variety of recording formats, including:

*   **X-OCN (eXtended Tonal Range Original Camera Negative):** X-OCN is a visually lossless compressed raw format. It offers different quality levels:
    *   **XT:** The highest quality X-OCN option.
    *   **ST:**  A standard quality option, balancing quality and file size.
    *   **LT:**  A "lite" option, for longer recording times and smaller file sizes.

    X-OCN provides the flexibility of raw recording (adjusting white balance, ISO, etc. in post) with significantly smaller file sizes than uncompressed raw. It's a 16-bit linear format.

*   **RAW:** Sony also offers a traditional RAW recording option on some cameras. This is uncompressed or minimally compressed raw data from the sensor.

*   **ProRes:** Like ARRI, Sony cameras also support Apple ProRes recording (various flavors like 422, 422 HQ, 4444, 4444 XQ).

*   **XAVC:** XAVC is Sony's H.264/AVC-based compression format. It offers different classes and bit depths (8-bit, 10-bit) depending on the camera and settings. XAVC is a more compressed format, suitable for applications where file size is a major concern.

* **Bit-depth and bandwidth details:**
    * X-OCN and RAW offer 16-bit linear data, preserving the maximum amount of information from the sensor.
    * ProRes options vary in bit depth (10-bit or 12-bit depending on the flavor).
    * XAVC options vary in bit depth (8-bit or 10-bit).

The choice of codec depends on the specific needs of the production, balancing image quality, file size, workflow requirements, and post-production considerations.
