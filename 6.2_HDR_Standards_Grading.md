# 6.2 HDR Standards and Grading

High Dynamic Range (HDR) video offers a wider range of brightness and color than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video, resulting in a more realistic and immersive viewing experience. Several HDR standards have emerged, each with its own specifications and requirements. This section covers the major HDR standards and the considerations for grading HDR content.

## Major HDR Standards

*   **HDR10:**
    *   **Transfer Function:** PQ (Perceptual Quantizer)
    *   **Metadata:** Static metadata (SMPTE ST 2086). This metadata describes the mastering display characteristics (peak brightness, color gamut) and is applied to the entire content.
    *   **Color Gamut:** Typically Rec. 2020 (although the content may not fill the entire gamut).
    *   **Bit Depth:** 10-bit or higher.
    *   **Open Standard:** HDR10 is an open standard, meaning it's royalty-free and widely supported by manufacturers.
    * **Limitations:** Static metadata means that the same tone mapping parameters are applied to the entire content, which may not be optimal for all scenes.

*   **Dolby Vision:**
    *   **Transfer Function:** PQ (Perceptual Quantizer)
    *   **Metadata:** Dynamic metadata (SMPTE ST 2094-10). This metadata is scene-by-scene (or even frame-by-frame), allowing for more precise tone mapping.
    *   **Color Gamut:** Typically Rec. 2020 (although the content may not fill the entire gamut).
    *   **Bit Depth:** 12-bit (although 10-bit delivery is common).
    *   **Proprietary Standard:** Dolby Vision is a proprietary standard, requiring licensing fees and certification.
    * **Advantages:** Dynamic metadata allows for more optimal tone mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, potentially resulting in a better viewing experience. Dolby Vision also includes a mapping to a variety of target displays.
    * **Workflow:** Requires Dolby Vision-compatible mastering tools and displays.

*   **HDR10+:**
    *   **Transfer Function:** PQ (Perceptual Quantizer)
    *   **Metadata:** Dynamic metadata (SMPTE ST 2094-40). Similar to Dolby Vision, HDR10+ uses dynamic metadata to optimize tone mapping on a scene-by-scene basis.
    *   **Color Gamut:** Typically Rec. 2020.
    *   **Bit Depth:** 10-bit or higher.
    *   **Open Standard:** HDR10+ is an open standard, but it was developed by Samsung and is not as widely adopted as HDR10 or Dolby Vision.

*   **HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma):**
    *   **Transfer Function:** HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma)
    *   **Metadata:** Typically no metadata required (although optional metadata can be included).
    *   **Color Gamut:** Typically Rec. 2020.
    *   **Bit Depth:** 10-bit or higher.
    *   **Backward Compatibility:** HLG is backward compatible with SDR displays.
    * **Primary Use Case:** Broadcast and live production.

## Grading HDR Content

Grading HDR content requires specialized tools and techniques compared to grading SDR content.

*   **HDR Mastering Display:**  You need an HDR mastering display that meets the requirements of the target HDR standard (e.g., a display capable of at least 1000 nits peak brightness for HDR10). The display should be properly calibrated.
*   **Color Grading Software:** Use color grading software that supports HDR workflows (e.g., DaVinci Resolve, Baselight, FilmLight).
*   **Color Space:** Grade in a wide-gamut color space (e.g., ACEScct, DaVinci Wide Gamut, Rec. 2020).
*   **Tone Mapping:** Understand how tone mapping works. Tone mapping is the process of adapting the HDR content to the capabilities of the display. Different displays have different peak brightness and color gamut capabilities, so tone mapping is necessary to ensure that the content looks its best on each display.
*   **Highlight Management:** Pay careful attention to highlights. Avoid clipping highlights, as this information will be lost. Use the wider dynamic range to create more realistic and detailed highlights.
*   **Shadow Detail:**  HDR allows for more detail in the shadows. Take advantage of this to create richer and more nuanced images.
*   **Color Volume:** Be aware of the color volume of your content. Color volume refers to the combination of color gamut and dynamic range.  HDR allows for a larger color volume than SDR.
* **Creative Intent:** While HDR offers more technical capabilities, remember that the creative intent of the project should always guide your grading decisions.

## Example: Grading for HDR10

1.  **Project Setup:** Set up your color grading project for HDR10. In DaVinci Resolve, this typically involves setting the Color Science to "DaVinci YRGB Color Managed" or "ACEScct", choosing Rec.2020 as the timeline color space, and selecting the ST.2084 (PQ) transfer function.
2.  **Input Transform:** Apply the appropriate input transform to convert your camera-native footage to your chosen working color space.
3.  **Grading:** Perform color grading, paying careful attention to highlights and shadows. Use the wider dynamic range and color gamut to enhance the image, but avoid pushing the colors or contrast too far.
4.  **Mastering Display:** Grade on a calibrated HDR mastering display that meets the requirements of HDR10 (e.g., at least 1000 nits peak brightness, P3 color gamut coverage).
5.  **Output Transform:** Apply the appropriate output transform to convert your graded footage to the HDR10 deliverable format (typically PQ, Rec. 2020).
6.  **Metadata:** Generate the static metadata for HDR10 (SMPTE ST 2086). This metadata includes information about the mastering display characteristics. In Resolve, this metadata is typically generated automatically when you render your output.
7.  **Quality Control:** Perform a quality control (QC) check on a consumer HDR display to ensure that the content looks as intended.

Grading for other HDR formats (Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HLG) involves similar principles, but the specific steps and tools may vary. Always consult the relevant standards and documentation for the specific format you're working with.
