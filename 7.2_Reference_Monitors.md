# 7.2 Setting up Reference Monitors

Setting up reference monitors correctly is crucial for on-set color management and ensuring that everyone is seeing an accurate representation of the image. This involves choosing the right monitor, calibrating it properly, and configuring it for the specific workflow.

## Choosing a Reference Monitor

*   **Color Accuracy:** The most important characteristic of a reference monitor is color accuracy. It should be able to accurately reproduce the target color space (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3, or Rec. 2020).
*   **Resolution:**  While 4K resolution is becoming increasingly common, 1080p (Full HD) is still sufficient for many on-set monitoring applications, especially if the final delivery is in HD.
*   **Panel Type:**
    *   **OLED:** OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) monitors offer excellent black levels, high contrast ratios, and wide viewing angles. They are a popular choice for reference monitors.
    *   **LCD:** LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors are more common and generally less expensive than OLEDs. However, they may have lower contrast ratios and narrower viewing angles. High-quality LCD monitors with local dimming can still be suitable for reference monitoring.
*   **Size:** The size of the monitor should be appropriate for the viewing distance and the number of people who need to see it.
*   **Inputs:** The monitor should have the necessary inputs for your workflow (e.g., SDI, HDMI).
*   **Features:** Look for features like built-in scopes (waveform, vectorscope), LUT support, and calibration tools.
* **HDR Capabilities:** If you are working with HDR content, you need a monitor that supports HDR and has sufficient peak brightness and a low black level.

## Calibration

Calibration is essential for ensuring that your reference monitor is displaying colors and luminance accurately.

1.  **Warm-up:** Allow the monitor to warm up for at least 30 minutes before calibration.
2.  **Colorimeter:** Use a high-quality colorimeter (e.g., a Klein K10-A, a X-Rite i1Display Pro, or a similar device) to measure the monitor's output. Spectroradiometers are even more accurate.
3.  **Calibration Software:** Use specialized calibration software (e.g., Calman, LightSpace CMS, or the monitor manufacturer's own software) to guide the calibration process.
4.  **Targets:** Calibrate the monitor to the appropriate targets for your workflow.
    *   **Rec. 709:** For standard dynamic range (SDR) monitoring, calibrate to Rec. 709 with a gamma of 2.4 (or BT.1886).
    *   **DCI-P3:** For digital cinema monitoring, calibrate to DCI-P3.
    *   **HDR:** For HDR monitoring, calibrate to the appropriate HDR standard (e.g., PQ/Rec. 2020 for HDR10).
5.  **White Point:** Set the white point to D65 (6500K), which is the standard white point for most video applications.
6.  **Black Level:** Set the black level as low as possible without crushing shadow detail.
7.  **Gamma:** Set the gamma to the appropriate value for your target color space (e.g., 2.4 for Rec. 709).
8.  **Grayscale Tracking:** Adjust the monitor's controls to achieve accurate grayscale tracking. This means that all shades of gray, from black to white, should have the correct color temperature (D65) and should not have any color casts.
9.  **Color Gamut:** Adjust the monitor's controls to match the target color gamut (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3).
10. **Verification:** After calibration, verify the results using test patterns (e.g., grayscale ramps, color bars) and real-world content. Use a waveform monitor and vectorscope to check for any clipping or color inaccuracies.
11. **Regular Recalibration:** Recalibrate your reference monitor regularly (e.g., every few weeks or months) to maintain accuracy. Monitors drift over time, so regular calibration is essential.

## Loading LUTs

Many reference monitors allow you to load Look Up Tables (LUTs) to preview different looks or to convert between color spaces.

1.  **LUT Format:** Make sure the LUT is in the correct format for your monitor. Common LUT formats include .cube, .3dl, and .lut.
2.  **LUT Size:** The size of the LUT (e.g., 17x17x17, 33x33x33) should be compatible with your monitor.
3.  **Loading the LUT:** Follow the monitor manufacturer's instructions for loading the LUT. This typically involves connecting a USB drive to the monitor or using a network connection.
4. **LUT Management:** Many monitors allow you to store multiple LUTs and switch between them easily.

## Workflow Integration

*   **Signal Flow:** Ensure that the video signal is routed correctly to the reference monitor. This may involve using a video router or a distribution amplifier.
*   **Color Space Management:** Make sure that the color space of the video signal matches the color space settings of the monitor. If you're using a LUT box, make sure that the LUT box is configured correctly.
*   **Viewing Environment:** The viewing environment can affect your perception of color. Ideally, you should view the reference monitor in a dimly lit room with neutral-colored walls. Avoid any strong reflections or glare on the screen.

By following these steps, you can set up your reference monitors correctly and ensure that you're seeing an accurate representation of your image on set. This is essential for making informed decisions about exposure, lighting, and color, and for maintaining consistency throughout the production process.
