# 4.2 Technical LUTs vs. Creative LUTs

LUTs (Lookup Tables), both 1D and 3D, can be broadly categorized into two main types: technical LUTs and creative LUTs. These categories reflect their primary purpose and how they are used in color management and grading workflows.

## Technical LUTs

*   **Purpose:** Technical LUTs are designed for *mathematically precise* color space conversions and transformations. They are used to ensure color accuracy and consistency across different devices and workflows.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Color Space Conversion:** Their primary function is to convert footage from one color space to another (e.g., Log C to Rec.709, S-Log3 to Rec.709, REDWideGamutRGB/Log3G10 to Rec.709, or ACEScg to Rec.709).
    *   **Mathematically Precise:** Technical LUTs are created based on precise mathematical formulas and color science principles. They are designed to be accurate and predictable.
    *   **Device-Specific:** Technical LUTs are often created for specific cameras, displays, or workflows. For example, a camera manufacturer might provide a technical LUT to convert their camera's Log footage to Rec.709 for viewing on a standard monitor.
    *   **Not Intended for Creative Looks:** Technical LUTs are not designed to create a specific "look" or style. Their purpose is purely technical – to ensure accurate color representation.

*   **Examples:**
    *   A LUT to convert ARRI Log C footage to Rec.709.
    *   A LUT to convert Sony S-Log3 footage to Rec.709.
    *   A LUT to convert REDWideGamutRGB/Log3G10 footage to DCI-P3.
    *   An Input Device Transform (IDT) in ACES, which converts camera-native footage to the ACES color space.
    *   An Output Device Transform (ODT) in ACES, which converts from ACES to a specific display color space.

## Creative LUTs

*   **Purpose:** Creative LUTs are designed to create a specific *stylistic look* or aesthetic. They are used to enhance the mood, atmosphere, and visual impact of an image.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Stylistic Adjustments:** Creative LUTs can make a wide range of adjustments to the color, contrast, and overall look of an image. They might be used to create a vintage film look, a desaturated look, a high-contrast look, or any other desired style.
    *   **Subjective:** Unlike technical LUTs, creative LUTs are subjective and based on artistic preference. There's no "right" or "wrong" creative LUT – it's all about achieving the desired look.
    *   **Often Created by Colorists:** Creative LUTs are often created by colorists or filmmakers to achieve a specific look for a project. They can also be purchased from various online vendors.
    *   **Can Be Combined with Technical LUTs:** Creative LUTs are often used *in conjunction with* technical LUTs. For example, a technical LUT might be used to convert Log footage to Rec.709, and then a creative LUT might be applied on top of that to add a specific style.

*   **Examples:**
    *   A LUT that emulates the look of a specific film stock (e.g., Kodak Vision3 250D).
    *   A LUT that creates a "teal and orange" look.
    *   A LUT that adds a warm, vintage feel to the image.
    *   A LUT that desaturates the colors and increases the contrast.

## Workflow Considerations

It's important to use technical and creative LUTs correctly in your workflow.  A common mistake is to apply a creative LUT *before* a technical LUT. This can lead to inaccurate results, as the creative LUT will be operating on the wrong color space.

The correct order is generally:

1.  **Input Transformation (Technical LUT):** Convert the footage from its native color space (e.g., Log) to a working color space (e.g., Rec.709 or ACEScg).
2.  **Color Grading (Creative LUTs and other adjustments):** Apply creative LUTs and make other color grading adjustments in the working color space.
3.  **Output Transformation (Technical LUT):** Convert the footage from the working color space to the final delivery color space (e.g., Rec.709 for broadcast, DCI-P3 for cinema).

By following this order, you ensure that your creative adjustments are made in a consistent and predictable color space, and that the final output is correctly formatted for the intended display device.
