# 11.3 Block Diagrams (Appendix)

This appendix provides block diagrams to visually represent the flow of data and color transformations in various digital cinema workflows.

## 1. Basic Camera to Display Pipeline (SDR)

```
[Scene] --> [Camera (Sensor, CFA, Processing)] --> [Log Encoding (e.g., Log C, S-Log3)] --> [Recording (Codec, Container)] --> [Post-Production (Editing, Grading)] --> [Display Transform (LUT, e.g., Rec. 709)] --> [Display (Rec. 709)]
```

*   **Scene:** The real-world scene being captured.
*   **Camera:** The camera sensor, color filter array (CFA), and in-camera processing.
*   **Log Encoding:** The logarithmic encoding applied to the image data (e.g., ARRI Log C, Sony S-Log3, RED Log3G10).
*   **Recording:** The codec and container format used to store the data (e.g., ProRes 422 HQ, X-OCN, REDCODE RAW).
*   **Post-Production:** Editing, color grading, and other post-production processes.
*   **Display Transform:** A LUT or other color transform that converts the footage to the display's color space (e.g., Rec. 709).
*   **Display:** The monitor or projector used to view the image.

## 2. ACES Workflow

```
[Scene] --> [Camera] --> [Camera Native (Log/RAW)] --> [IDT] --> [ACES2065-1 (AP0)] --> [RRT] + [ODT] --> [Display]
                      ^                                                                     |
                      |                                                                     |
                      +--- [Optional: ACEScg (for VFX)] <-------------------------------------+
                      |
                      +--- [Optional: ACEScct (for Grading)] <--------------------------------+
                      |
                      +--- [Optional: LMT] ------------------------------------------------>+
```

*   **Camera Native:** The camera's raw or log-encoded output.
*   **IDT (Input Device Transform):** Converts the camera-native data to the ACES2065-1 color space.
*   **ACES2065-1 (AP0):** The wide-gamut, linear ACES color space.
*   **ACEScg (AP1):** A linear working space for visual effects.
*   **ACEScct:** A logarithmic working space for color grading.
*   **LMT (Look Modification Transform):** An optional transform for applying creative looks.
*   **RRT (Reference Rendering Transform):** A conceptual transform that converts ACES2065-1 to a standard display-referred representation. The RRT is effectively built into the ODTs.
*   **ODT (Output Device Transform):** Converts from ACES to a specific display color space (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3, Rec. 2020).
* **Display:** The monitor.

## 3. HDR Workflow (Simplified - PQ)

```
[Scene] --> [Camera] --> [Log/RAW] --> [Color Grading (Wide Gamut Color Space)] --> [PQ Encoding] --> [HDR Display (PQ)]
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                                    +--- [Optional: Tone Mapping for SDR Display]
```

*   **Log/RAW:** Camera's output.
*   **Color Grading:** Grading is performed in a wide-gamut color space (e.g., ACEScct, Rec. 2020).
*   **PQ Encoding:** The image data is encoded with the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) transfer function.
*   **HDR Display (PQ):** An HDR display that supports the PQ transfer function.
* **Tone Mapping:** Optional tone mapping may be applied to create an SDR version of the content.

## 4. On-Set Color Management (Simplified)

```
[Camera] --> [Log Output] --> [LUT Box] --> [Display LUT (e.g., Rec. 709)] --> [On-Set Monitor]
                                  ^
                                  |
                                  +--- [Optional: Live Grading Software (CDL adjustments)]
```

* **Camera:** The camera's output (typically a Log signal).
* **LUT Box:** A device that applies a LUT to the video signal in real-time.
* **Display LUT:** A LUT that converts the Log signal to a standard display color space (e.g., Rec. 709).
* **On-Set Monitor:** A calibrated monitor used to view the image on set.
* **Live Grading Software (Optional):** Software like Pomfort Livegrade can be used to make CDL adjustments and create LUTs on set.

These block diagrams provide a simplified overview of common workflows. The specific details of each workflow can vary depending on the project's requirements and the chosen tools.
