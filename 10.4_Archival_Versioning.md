# 10.4 Archival and Versioning

Proper archival and versioning are essential for protecting your valuable film assets and ensuring that you can access and utilize them in the future. This involves creating multiple copies of your data, storing them in different locations, and using a clear and consistent naming convention.

## Archival Best Practices

*   **Multiple Copies:** Create at least three copies of your data:
    *   **Original Camera Files (OCF):** The untouched, original files from the camera. These should *never* be altered.
    *   **Working Copy:** A copy used for editing, grading, and other post-production work.
    *   **Backup Copy:** A separate backup copy, stored in a different location from the working copy.
    *   **Off-site Copy:** A copy stored in a geographically separate location (e.g., a different building, a cloud storage service) to protect against disasters like fire or flood.

*   **Storage Media:**
    *   **LTO Tape:** LTO (Linear Tape-Open) is a widely used and cost-effective format for long-term archival. LTO tapes have a long shelf life (up to 30 years) and high storage capacity.
    *   **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):** HDDs can be used for near-line storage and for creating working copies. However, HDDs are more susceptible to failure than LTO tapes, so they are not ideal for long-term archival.
    *   **Solid State Drives (SSDs):** SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs, but they are also more expensive. They are typically used for on-set recording and for editing, rather than for long-term archival.
    *   **Cloud Storage:** Cloud storage services can be used for backup and off-site storage. However, it's important to choose a reputable provider and to understand the costs and limitations of cloud storage.

*   **File Formats:**
    *   **Original Camera Files (OCF):** Archive the original camera files in their native format (e.g., ARRIRAW, REDCODE RAW, X-OCN, ProRes). Do *not* transcode or convert the OCF.
    *   **Mezzanine Files:** You may also want to create high-quality mezzanine files (e.g., ProRes 4444, DNxHR 444) for use in post-production. These can be archived alongside the OCF.
    *   **Open and Standardized Formats:** For long-term archival, consider using open and standardized formats whenever possible. This will help to ensure that your files can be accessed and read in the future, even if the original software or hardware is no longer available.

*   **Checksums:** Use checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) to verify the integrity of your files. A checksum is a unique "fingerprint" of a file. By comparing the checksum of a file before and after copying or transferring it, you can ensure that the file has not been corrupted.

*   **Metadata:** Preserve all relevant metadata, including camera settings, lens information, on-set LUTs/CDLs, and any notes from the production.

*   **Documentation:** Document your archival workflow, including the file formats, storage media, and procedures used.

*   **Regular Verification:** Periodically verify the integrity of your archived data by checking checksums and attempting to read the files.

* **Migration:** As technology evolves, you may need to migrate your archived data to new storage media or file formats to ensure its long-term accessibility.

## Versioning

Versioning is the process of managing different versions of your project files. This is important for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and reverting to previous versions if necessary.

*   **Consistent Naming Convention:** Use a clear and consistent naming convention for your files and folders. Include information such as the project name, date, version number, and any relevant details (e.g., scene, shot, take).
*   **Version Control Software:** Consider using version control software (e.g., Git, Perforce, Subversion) to manage your project files. Version control software tracks changes to files, allows you to revert to previous versions, and facilitates collaboration. However, these systems are not always well-suited to very large video files.
*   **Project File Backups:** Regularly back up your project files (e.g., Avid project files, Premiere Pro project files, DaVinci Resolve project files).
*   **Rendered Outputs:** Keep track of different versions of rendered outputs (e.g., different color grades, different edits).
