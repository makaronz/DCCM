# 7.4 Creating On-Set LUTs/CDLs

Creating LUTs (Look Up Tables) and CDLs (Color Decision Lists) on set is a crucial part of a modern digital cinema workflow. It allows the cinematographer and director to preview a look that is closer to the final graded image, ensuring that their creative intent is maintained throughout the production process. It also facilitates communication with the post-production team.

## LUTs vs. CDLs

*   **LUTs (Lookup Tables):** As discussed previously (section 4.1), LUTs are pre-calculated tables that map input color values to output color values. They can be 1D (affecting only contrast and gamma) or 3D (affecting hue, saturation, and luminance). 3D LUTs are more commonly used for on-set looks.
*   **CDLs (Color Decision Lists):** A CDL is a simpler, more limited form of color correction. It consists of a set of parameters that define basic color adjustments:
    *   **Slope:**  Similar to gain or contrast. Affects the overall brightness of the color channel.
    *   **Offset:** Similar to lift or brightness. Adds or subtracts a constant value to the color channel.
    *   **Power:** Similar to gamma. Affects the midtones of the color channel.
    *   **Saturation:** Controls the overall saturation of the image.

    A CDL applies the *same* adjustments to all colors in the image. It cannot perform localized or color-specific corrections.

## Creating LUTs On Set

1.  **Live Grading Software:** Use live grading software like Pomfort Livegrade Pro, Assimilate Live Looks, or Colorfront On-Set Dailies. These applications allow you to make color adjustments in real-time and then export those adjustments as a LUT.
2.  **Reference Monitor:** Use a calibrated reference monitor to view the image while making color adjustments.
3.  **Input Signal:** Ensure that the live grading software is receiving the correct input signal from the camera (typically a Log signal).
4.  **Color Adjustments:** Make color adjustments using the software's controls (wheels, curves, etc.). These adjustments might include:
    *   White balance
    *   Exposure
    *   Contrast
    *   Saturation
    *   Hue shifts
    *   Lift/Gamma/Gain adjustments
5.  **LUT Generation:** Once you're happy with the look, export the color adjustments as a 3D LUT. The software will generate a .cube file (or another appropriate format).
6.  **LUT Naming:** Give the LUT a descriptive name that includes information about the scene, shot, and any specific adjustments made.
7.  **LUT Distribution:** Distribute the LUT to the relevant parties (DIT, post-production team, etc.).

## Creating CDLs On Set

1.  **Live Grading Software:** Use live grading software that supports CDL creation (e.g., Pomfort Livegrade Pro, Assimilate Live Looks).
2.  **Reference Monitor:** Use a calibrated reference monitor.
3.  **Input Signal:** Ensure the correct input signal.
4.  **Color Adjustments:** Make color adjustments using the software's CDL controls (slope, offset, power, saturation).
5.  **CDL Export:** Export the CDL values. The software will typically generate a .cdl file (or another appropriate format, like an .edl with CDL information).
6.  **CDL Naming:** Give the CDL a descriptive name.
7.  **CDL Distribution:** Distribute the CDL to the relevant parties.

## Using LUTs and CDLs Together

LUTs and CDLs can be used together. A common workflow is:

1.  **Base LUT:** Apply a technical LUT to convert the camera's Log signal to a standard color space (e.g., Rec. 709).
2.  **CDL Adjustments:** Apply CDL adjustments on top of the base LUT to make scene-specific corrections or to create a specific look.
3. **Creative LUT (Optional):** A creative LUT can be applied after the CDL for further stylistic adjustments.

This approach allows for a combination of technical accuracy (with the base LUT) and creative flexibility (with the CDL and creative LUT).

## Workflow Considerations

*   **Non-Destructive:** On-set color adjustments should be non-destructive. The original camera footage should be preserved, and the LUTs/CDLs should be applied as separate metadata.
*   **Communication:** Communicate clearly with the post-production team about the LUTs and CDLs that were created on set. Provide them with the LUT/CDL files and any relevant notes.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in your on-set color management workflow. Use the same monitors, LUT boxes, and software throughout the production.
* **Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your monitors and other equipment.

Creating LUTs and CDLs on set is a powerful way to establish a look early in the production process and to ensure that everyone is on the same page creatively. By following best practices and using the right tools, you can streamline your workflow and improve the overall quality of your final product.
