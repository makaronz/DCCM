# 2.3 RED Cameras (V-RAPTOR, DSMC2 lineup)

## Sensor Designs

RED Digital Cinema is known for its modular camera systems and high-resolution sensors.  Unlike ARRI and Sony, which have largely standardized on a few sensor sizes, RED offers a wider variety of sensors with different resolutions and characteristics.

*   **DSMC2 Lineup:**  DSMC2 (Digital Still and Motion Camera, 2nd generation) is RED's previous generation of camera bodies.  It includes cameras with various sensors:
    *   **Monstro 8K VV:**  A full-frame (40.96mm x 21.60mm) sensor with 8K resolution.
    *   **Helium 8K S35:**  A Super 35mm sensor with 8K resolution.
    *   **Gemini 5K S35:**  A Super 35mm sensor with 5K resolution and a dual-sensitivity mode (similar to dual-base ISO).
    *   **Dragon-X 6K S35:** A Super 35mm sensor with 6k Resolution.

* **V-RAPTOR 8K VV:** The V-RAPTOR is RED's current flagship camera. It features an 8K VV (Vista Vision) sensor (40.96mm x 21.60mm), which is slightly larger than full-frame. The V-RAPTOR also has a claimed dynamic range of 17+ stops.
* **V-RAPTOR XL 8K VV:** A larger, more fully-featured version of the V-RAPTOR, with more built-in I/O and accessories.
* **KOMODO 6K S35:** A compact, Super 35, 6K global shutter camera.

RED sensors are known for their high resolution and detail.  The modularity of RED's camera systems allows users to choose the sensor and accessories that best suit their needs.

## REDWideGamut RGB, Log3G10, and IPP2

RED has its own color science and image processing pipeline.

*   **REDWideGamut RGB:** This is RED's very wide color gamut, designed to capture the maximum range of colors possible with their sensors. It's larger than Rec.2020.
*   **Log3G10:** This is RED's logarithmic encoding.  The "G10" refers to a gain of 10, which is part of the mathematical formula. Log3G10 is designed to capture the wide dynamic range of RED sensors and provide flexibility in post-production.
*   **IPP2 (Image Processing Pipeline 2):** IPP2 is RED's latest image processing pipeline. It offers improvements over the previous pipeline, including:
    *   Improved color science and accuracy.
    *   Better highlight handling (reducing the risk of clipping).
    *   Enhanced shadow detail.
    *   A more streamlined workflow.

IPP2 is designed to work with REDWideGamut RGB and Log3G10. It provides a standardized workflow from capture to delivery.

## REDCODE RAW

REDCODE RAW is RED's proprietary raw codec. It's a key feature of RED cameras, offering a balance between image quality and file size.

*   **Compression Ratios:** REDCODE RAW uses wavelet compression, allowing for variable compression ratios.  Common ratios include:
    *   3:1 (very low compression)
    *   5:1
    *   8:1
    *   Higher ratios (for longer recording times and smaller file sizes)

    The choice of compression ratio depends on the specific needs of the production.  Lower compression ratios provide higher image quality but result in larger files.

*   **Bit-depth:** REDCODE RAW is a 16-bit format, preserving a large amount of color information.

*   **Raw Decoding Parameters:**  One of the key advantages of raw recording is the ability to adjust various parameters in post-production *as if* they were being changed on set.  With REDCODE RAW, you can adjust:
    *   ISO
    *   White balance
    *   Exposure
    *   Color temperature
    *   Tint
    *   And other parameters

    This provides significant flexibility in post-production, allowing for corrections and creative adjustments that would not be possible with "baked-in" codecs.

REDCODE RAW is a powerful and flexible format, but it requires significant processing power to work with.  RED provides software (REDCINE-X PRO) and hardware (RED ROCKET-X) to accelerate the decoding and processing of REDCODE RAW footage.
