# 8.1 Overview of Major Codecs

A codec (coder-decoder) is a software or hardware component that encodes and decodes digital data, in this case, video data. Codecs are essential for compressing video files to manageable sizes for storage and transmission. Different codecs have different characteristics, affecting image quality, file size, processing requirements, and suitability for various applications.

## Key Concepts

*   **Compression:** Codecs use various compression techniques to reduce the size of video files.
    *   **Lossy Compression:**  Lossy compression algorithms discard some data to achieve higher compression ratios. This results in some loss of image quality, but the goal is to make the loss imperceptible or minimally noticeable. Most video codecs used in production and post-production are lossy.
    *   **Lossless Compression:** Lossless compression algorithms reduce file size without discarding any data. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed file. Lossless codecs are typically used for archival purposes, where preserving the absolute maximum image quality is paramount. However, they result in much larger file sizes than lossy codecs.
    *   **Intra-frame Compression:** Intra-frame compression (also called spatial compression) compresses each frame of video individually, without reference to other frames. This is like how JPEG compresses still images.
    *   **Inter-frame Compression:** Inter-frame compression (also called temporal compression) compresses video by storing only the *differences* between consecutive frames. This is much more efficient than intra-frame compression for most video content, as there is often a lot of redundancy between frames.

*   **Bit Depth:** Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent each color component (red, green, blue) of a pixel. Higher bit depth allows for more granular color representation and reduces the likelihood of banding artifacts. Common bit depths include 8-bit, 10-bit, 12-bit, and 16-bit.

*   **Chroma Subsampling:** Chroma subsampling is a technique that reduces the amount of color information stored in a video signal, while preserving most of the luminance (brightness) information. This is based on the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness than to changes in color. Common chroma subsampling schemes include:
    *   **4:4:4:** Full color information for each pixel. No chroma subsampling.
    *   **4:2:2:**  Horizontal color resolution is halved.
    *   **4:2:0:** Both horizontal and vertical color resolution are halved.

* **Bitrate:** Bitrate refers to the amount of data used to represent each second of video, typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or kilobits per second (kbps). Higher bitrate generally means higher image quality, but also larger file sizes.
    * **Constant Bitrate (CBR):** The bitrate remains constant throughout the video.
    * **Variable Bitrate (VBR):** The bitrate varies depending on the complexity of the video content.

## Major Codecs

*   **ProRes (Apple ProRes):** A family of high-quality, lossy codecs developed by Apple. ProRes is widely used in professional video production and post-production.
    *   **ProRes 422:** A good balance of quality and file size, suitable for many applications.
    *   **ProRes 422 HQ:** Higher quality than ProRes 422, with less compression.
    *   **ProRes 4444:** Offers even higher quality, including an alpha channel (for transparency).
    *   **ProRes 4444 XQ:** The highest quality ProRes option, with minimal compression.
    *   **ProRes RAW:** A raw codec that offers the flexibility of raw recording with the efficiency of ProRes.
    * **Characteristics:** Intra-frame compression, 10-bit or 12-bit, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling. Designed for editing and post-production.

*   **DNxHR (Avid DNxHR):** A family of high-quality, lossy codecs developed by Avid. DNxHR is similar to ProRes and is also widely used in professional video production and post-production.
    *   **DNxHR LB:** Low Bandwidth. For offline editing.
    *   **DNxHR SQ:** Standard Quality.
    *   **DNxHR HQ:** High Quality.
    *   **DNxHR HQX:** High Quality (10/12-bit).
    *   **DNxHR 444:** 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.
    * **Characteristics:** Intra-frame compression, 8-bit or 10/12-bit, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling. Designed for editing and post-production.

*   **XAVC (Sony XAVC):** A family of codecs developed by Sony, based on the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard. XAVC is used in a wide range of Sony cameras, from consumer camcorders to professional cinema cameras.
    *   **XAVC-I:** Intra-frame compression.
    *   **XAVC-L:** Inter-frame (Long GOP) compression.
    *   **XAVC-S:** A consumer version of XAVC, using Long GOP compression and the MP4 container format.
    * **Characteristics:** Various bit depths (8-bit, 10-bit), chroma subsampling schemes (4:2:0, 4:2:2), and compression levels.

*   **REDCODE RAW (RED Digital Cinema):** A proprietary raw codec used by RED cameras. REDCODE RAW uses wavelet compression and offers variable compression ratios.
    * **Characteristics:** 16-bit, raw data, variable compression ratios.

*   **ARRIRAW (ARRI):** An uncompressed raw format used by ARRI cameras.
    * **Characteristics:** 12-bit or 16-bit, raw data, uncompressed.

*   **H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC):** A widely used lossy codec for video distribution. H.264 is used for Blu-ray discs, streaming video, web video, and many other applications.
    * **Characteristics:** Inter-frame compression, typically 8-bit (but can support higher bit depths), various chroma subsampling schemes. Highly efficient, but can be computationally intensive to encode.

*   **H.265 (HEVC - High Efficiency Video Coding):** The successor to H.264. H.265 offers significantly better compression efficiency than H.264, allowing for similar image quality at lower bitrates.
    * **Characteristics:** Inter-frame compression, typically 8-bit or 10-bit, various chroma subsampling schemes.

* **AV1:** A modern, open-source, and royalty-free codec designed to compete with HEVC.

* **JPEG 2000:** Used in Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs). Can be lossless or lossy.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers some of the most important codecs used in professional video production and post-production. The choice of codec depends on a variety of factors, including the specific camera being used, the desired image quality, the workflow requirements, and the delivery format.
