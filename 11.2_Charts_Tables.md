# 11.2 Charts/Tables (Appendix)

This appendix provides a collection of charts and tables that illustrate key concepts related to color management in digital cinema.

## Dynamic Range Comparison (Illustrative)

| Camera/Format      | Approximate Dynamic Range (Stops) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Standard Video (Rec. 709) | 6-8                               |
| ARRI ALEXA 35      | 17+                               |
| ARRI ALEXA LF      | 14+                               |
| Sony VENICE 2      | 16 (8.6K sensor)                  |
| Sony VENICE       | 15+                               |
| RED V-RAPTOR       | 17+                               |
| RED MONSTRO        | 17+                               |
| Canon C700 FF      | 15                                |
| Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K | 14                                |

**Note:** These are approximate values, and the actual dynamic range can vary depending on the specific camera settings and measurement methods.

## Bit Depth Illustration

| Bit Depth | Levels per Channel | Total Possible Colors        |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 8-bit     | 256                | 16.7 million                 |
| 10-bit    | 1024               | 1.07 billion                 |
| 12-bit    | 4096               | 68.7 billion                 |
| 16-bit    | 65536              | 281 trillion                 |

## Color Gamut Comparison (Illustrative)

It's difficult to represent color gamuts accurately in text. A visual representation (a chromaticity diagram) is much more effective. However, we can provide a textual description:

*   **Rec. 709:** A relatively small triangle within the CIE chromaticity diagram. Covers a limited range of colors, primarily those achievable on standard HDTVs.
*   **DCI-P3:** A larger triangle than Rec. 709, extending further into the green and red regions.
*   **Rec. 2020:** A much larger triangle than both Rec. 709 and DCI-P3, covering a significant portion of the visible spectrum.  It's closer to the full range of human vision, but current display technology cannot fully reproduce it.
* **ACES2065-1 (AP0):** Encompasses the entire visible spectrum and even includes imaginary primaries.

**Note:** A proper visual representation using a CIE chromaticity diagram would be included in a full document.

These charts and tables provide a concise overview of some of the key technical aspects of color management. They are intended to be a helpful reference, but they are not a substitute for a thorough understanding of the underlying concepts.
