# 7.3 Wireless Video and Color Accuracy

Wireless video transmission is increasingly common on film sets, allowing for greater mobility and flexibility. However, transmitting video wirelessly introduces potential challenges for maintaining color accuracy. It's crucial to understand these challenges and to use systems that are designed to preserve color fidelity.

## Challenges of Wireless Video Transmission

*   **Compression:** Most wireless video systems use some form of compression to reduce the bandwidth required for transmission. Compression can introduce artifacts, such as banding, blocking, or color shifts.
*   **Latency:** Wireless transmission can introduce latency (delay) in the video signal. This can be problematic for critical monitoring applications, such as live grading or focus pulling.
*   **Interference:** Wireless signals can be susceptible to interference from other devices operating on the same frequency band. This can lead to signal degradation or dropouts.
*   **Limited Bandwidth:** Wireless transmission has limited bandwidth compared to wired connections. This can restrict the resolution, frame rate, or bit depth of the video signal.
* **Color Space Conversion:** The wireless system may perform color space conversions, which can introduce inaccuracies if not handled correctly.

## Systems for Maintaining Color Accuracy

Several wireless video systems are designed to minimize these challenges and maintain color accuracy.

*   **Teradek COLR:** Teradek COLR is a popular system that combines wireless video transmission with color management. It includes a LUT box that can apply 3D LUTs and CDLs (Color Decision Lists) to the video signal *before* it's transmitted wirelessly. This ensures that the color transformations are applied to the uncompressed signal, minimizing artifacts. The COLR system also supports real-time color grading and wireless transmission of color metadata.
*   **Teradek Bolt:** Teradek Bolt is a series of wireless video transmitters and receivers that are widely used in the film industry. While the Bolt itself doesn't perform color processing, it's often used in conjunction with the COLR system or other LUT boxes to maintain color accuracy. Higher-end Bolt systems offer very low latency and visually lossless compression.
*   **Amimon Connex:** Amimon is another manufacturer of wireless video systems. Their Connex systems offer low latency and high image quality.
* **Other Systems:** Several other companies offer wireless video systems, including Vaxis, Hollyland, and DJI.

## Best Practices for Wireless Video and Color Accuracy

*   **Use a Color-Managed System:** Choose a wireless video system that supports color management, such as the Teradek COLR.
*   **Apply LUTs Before Transmission:** If possible, apply LUTs and other color transformations *before* the video signal is compressed and transmitted wirelessly. This helps to minimize artifacts.
*   **Minimize Compression:** Use the lowest compression setting possible that still provides reliable transmission.
*   **Choose a Low-Latency System:** If latency is a concern, choose a system that offers low latency (e.g., less than 1 millisecond).
*   **Avoid Interference:** Choose a system that operates on a frequency band that is less likely to experience interference. Use directional antennas to improve signal strength and reduce interference.
*   **Monitor the Signal:** Use a waveform monitor and vectorscope to monitor the video signal and ensure that it's within the legal range and free of artifacts.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Before using a wireless video system on a critical project, test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets your requirements for color accuracy, latency, and reliability. Test in conditions similar to those you'll encounter on set.
* **Understand System Limitations:** Be aware of the limitations of your wireless system. No wireless system is perfect, and there will always be some trade-offs between image quality, latency, range, and cost.

By following these best practices, you can minimize the risks associated with wireless video transmission and maintain color accuracy on set.
