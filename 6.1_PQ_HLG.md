# 6.1 PQ and HLG Fundamentals

PQ (Perceptual Quantizer) and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) are two fundamentally different transfer functions used in High Dynamic Range (HDR) video. They define how digital code values are mapped to light output on an HDR display, but they do so in different ways, with different goals and characteristics.

## PQ (Perceptual Quantizer)

*   **Definition:** PQ, standardized as SMPTE ST 2084, is an *absolute* transfer function designed to match the contrast sensitivity of the human visual system. This means that a specific code value in PQ corresponds to a specific, absolute luminance level (measured in nits). For example, a code value representing 100 nits in PQ should always represent 100 nits of light output on a calibrated display, regardless of the display's maximum brightness.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Absolute:** As mentioned, PQ is an absolute standard. Code values have a fixed relationship to luminance levels.
    *   **Designed for HDR:** PQ is specifically designed for HDR content, with a peak luminance capability of up to 10,000 nits.
    *   **Requires Metadata:** PQ requires metadata (static or dynamic) to describe the content's mastering display characteristics (peak brightness, color gamut) and to help the display tone map the content correctly.
    *   **Not Backward Compatible:** PQ is not inherently backward compatible with Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) displays. A PQ signal displayed on an SDR display without proper tone mapping will look incorrect.
    * **Used in HDR10 and Dolby Vision:** PQ is the foundation of HDR formats like HDR10 (which uses static metadata) and Dolby Vision (which uses dynamic, scene-by-scene metadata).

* **Mathematical Representation (Simplified):** The PQ transfer function is complex and non-linear. It's based on the Barten model of human contrast sensitivity. A simplified representation is:

    ```
    L = ( (c1 + c2 * Y^m1) / (1 + c3 * Y^m1) ) ^ m2
    ```

    Where:

    *   `L` is the absolute luminance in nits.
    *   `Y` is the normalized code value (ranging from 0 to 1).
    *   `m1`, `m2`, `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` are constants defined in the SMPTE ST 2084 standard.

## HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma)

*   **Definition:** HLG, developed by the BBC and NHK, is a *relative* transfer function that is backward compatible with SDR displays. This means that an HLG signal can be displayed on both SDR and HDR displays without requiring separate SDR and HDR versions.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Relative:** HLG is a relative standard. The luminance represented by a code value depends on the display's peak brightness.
    *   **Backward Compatible:** The lower part of the HLG signal uses a standard gamma curve (similar to Rec. 709), making it compatible with SDR displays. The upper part of the signal uses a logarithmic curve to encode the additional dynamic range for HDR displays.
    *   **No Metadata Required (Generally):** HLG typically does not require metadata, simplifying the workflow. However, some HLG implementations may include optional metadata.
    *   **Designed for Broadcast:** HLG is particularly well-suited for broadcast applications, where it's important to have a single signal that can be displayed on both SDR and HDR TVs.

*   **Mathematical Representation (Simplified):** The HLG transfer function combines a gamma curve for the lower range and a logarithmic curve for the upper range. A simplified representation is:

    ```
    if (Y <= 0.5) {
      L = Y ^ γ;  // Gamma curve (similar to Rec. 709)
    } else {
      L = a * ln(Y - b) + c; // Logarithmic curve
    }
    ```

    Where:

    *   `L` is the relative luminance.
    *   `Y` is the normalized code value.
    *   `γ`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants defined in the ARIB STD-B67 standard.

## Choosing Between PQ and HLG

*   **Choose PQ when:**
    *   You need the highest possible image quality and dynamic range.
    *   You're working on a project that will be mastered and delivered in HDR (e.g., a feature film, a streaming series).
    *   You have control over the entire workflow, from capture to display.

*   **Choose HLG when:**
    *   You need backward compatibility with SDR displays.
    *   You're working on a live broadcast or other application where simplicity and compatibility are paramount.
    *   You want to avoid the complexity of managing metadata.

In some cases, a project might use both PQ and HLG. For example, a broadcaster might produce content in HLG for live transmission and then create a PQ version for on-demand streaming.
