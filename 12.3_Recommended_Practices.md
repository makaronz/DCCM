# 12.3 Recommended Practices Checklist

This section provides a checklist of recommended practices for color management in digital cinema, covering pre-production, production, and post-production.

## Pre-Production

*   [ ] **Define the Color Workflow:**
    *   [ ] Choose a color management approach (e.g., ACES, camera-native).
    *   [ ] Determine the working color space (e.g., ACEScct, ARRI Wide Gamut/Log C).
    *   [ ] Define the target display(s) and delivery format(s) (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3, HDR10, Dolby Vision).
    *   [ ] Plan for any specific color transformations (e.g., LUTs, CDLs).

*   [ ] **Camera Selection and Testing:**
    *   [ ] Choose the appropriate camera(s) for the project.
    *   [ ] Conduct camera tests to evaluate dynamic range, color reproduction, noise characteristics, and workflow compatibility.
    *   [ ] Determine the optimal recording format (e.g., RAW, Log, specific codec and settings).

*   [ ] **Monitor Selection and Calibration:**
    *   [ ] Select appropriate monitors for on-set and post-production use.
    *   [ ] Calibrate all monitors to the relevant standards (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3).
    *   [ ] Establish a consistent viewing environment.

*   [ ] **LUT/CDL Planning:**
    *   [ ] Plan for the creation and use of on-set LUTs/CDLs.
    *   [ ] Determine who will be responsible for creating and managing LUTs/CDLs.

*   [ ] **Communication:**
    *   [ ] Discuss the color workflow with the cinematographer, DIT, colorist, and post-production supervisor.
    *   [ ] Ensure that everyone understands the chosen workflow and their responsibilities.

## Production (On-Set)

*   [ ] **Camera Setup:**
    *   [ ] Set the camera to the correct white balance, ISO, and exposure settings.
    *   [ ] Use the chosen recording format and color space.
    *   [ ] Record all relevant metadata.

*   [ ] **Exposure:**
    *   [ ] Monitor exposure carefully, avoiding clipping highlights and crushing shadows.
    *   [ ] Use exposure tools (e.g., waveform monitor, false color, zebras).
    *   [ ] Expose to the right (ETTR) when shooting Log, without clipping highlights.

*   [ ] **On-Set Color Management:**
    *   [ ] Use calibrated on-set monitors.
    *   [ ] Apply viewing LUTs to monitor the image with a look that is closer to the intended final grade.
    *   [ ] Use a LUT box (e.g., Teradek COLR, Flanders Scientific BoxIO) for consistent color across multiple monitors.
    *   [ ] Create CDLs and/or 3D LUTs for on-set looks using live grading software (e.g., Pomfort Livegrade).
    *   [ ] Communicate color decisions to the DIT and post-production team.

*   [ ] **Data Management:**
    *   [ ] Offload footage securely using a DIT cart and appropriate software.
    *   [ ] Create multiple backups (at least three copies, with one off-site).
    *   [ ] Verify data integrity using checksums.
    *   [ ] Organize files with a clear and consistent naming convention.

* **[ ] Wireless Video:**
    * Use a color-managed wireless video system.
    * Apply LUTs *before* wireless transmission if possible.

## Post-Production (Editorial)

*   [ ] **Footage Ingest:**
    *   [ ] Import footage into the editing software.
    *   [ ] Organize and manage media effectively.

*   [ ] **On-Set LUTs/CDLs:**
    *   [ ] Apply the on-set LUTs/CDLs to the footage in the editing software.
    *   [ ] Evaluate the look and make minor adjustments as needed (in consultation with the cinematographer/director).

*   [ ] **Offline Editing (if applicable):**
    *   [ ] Create proxy files for offline editing if necessary.
    *   [ ] Apply the on-set LUTs/CDLs to the proxy files.

* **[ ] Communication:**
    * Maintain communication with the colorist and other members of the post-production team.

## Post-Production (Color Grading)

*   [ ] **Conform:**
    *   [ ] Conform the online edit using the original camera files.

*   [ ] **Color Management:**
    *   [ ] Use a color-managed workflow (e.g., ACES, DaVinci Resolve Color Management).
    *   [ ] Apply the appropriate input transforms (e.g., IDTs in ACES).
    *   [ ] Grade in a wide-gamut color space.

*   [ ] **Grading:**
    *   [ ] Perform color grading, referencing the on-set LUTs/CDLs and any notes from the cinematographer/director.
    *   [ ] Maintain color consistency throughout the project.
    *   [ ] Pay careful attention to highlights and shadows, especially when grading HDR content.

*   [ ] **Monitoring:**
    *   [ ] Grade on a calibrated reference monitor in a controlled environment.

*   [ ] **Output:**
    *   [ ] Apply the appropriate output transforms for the target display(s).
    *   [ ] Render the final output in the required format(s) for delivery.

* **[ ] Quality Control (QC):**
    * Perform thorough QC checks to ensure technical accuracy and identify any artifacts.

## Archival

*   [ ] **Multiple Copies:** Create at least three copies of all project assets (original camera files, project files, rendered outputs, LUTs/CDLs, metadata).
*   [ ] **Storage:** Store copies in multiple locations, including an off-site location.
*   [ ] **Verification:** Regularly verify the integrity of the archived data.
*   [ ] **Documentation:** Document the archival process and the location of all assets.
* [ ] **Format:** Archive using original camera format and a high-quality mezzanine format.

This checklist provides a comprehensive overview of recommended practices for color management. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your projects are technically sound, creatively consistent, and well-prepared for the future. Remember to adapt these recommendations to the specific needs of each project.
