# 9.3 Display-Referred vs. Scene-Referred

The terms "display-referred" and "scene-referred" describe two fundamentally different approaches to representing and managing color in digital imaging. Understanding this distinction is crucial for color management and grading workflows.

## Scene-Referred

*   **Definition:** In a scene-referred representation, the color values represent the light levels of the *original scene*, as captured by the camera sensor (before any display-related transformations). The colorimetry is directly related to the scene's light.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Linear Light:** Scene-referred images are typically encoded with a linear transfer function (or a logarithmic encoding that is designed to capture a wide dynamic range, and is later linearized). This means that the code values are directly proportional to the light intensity in the scene.
    *   **Wide Dynamic Range:** Scene-referred representations can capture a very wide dynamic range, exceeding the capabilities of any display device.
    *   **Wide Color Gamut:** Scene-referred images often use a wide color gamut (e.g., camera native gamuts, ACES2065-1) to encompass all the colors captured by the camera.
    *   **Not Directly Viewable:** Scene-referred images are not intended for direct viewing on a display. They require a *display rendering transform* to map the scene-referred values to the specific characteristics of the display device.
    * **Examples:**
        *   RAW camera data
        *   Log-encoded footage (e.g., ARRI Log C, Sony S-Log3, RED Log3G10) *before* any display LUT is applied.
        *   ACES2065-1 (the core ACES color space)
        *   OpenEXR files (when encoded with linear light)

* **Analogy:** A scene-referred image is like a film negative. It contains all the information captured by the camera, but it needs to be "developed" (rendered) to be viewed on a specific display.

## Display-Referred

*   **Definition:** In a display-referred representation, the color values represent the light levels that should be *displayed* on a specific display device. The colorimetry is relative to the display's capabilities.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Non-Linear Encoding:** Display-referred images are typically encoded with a non-linear transfer function (e.g., gamma 2.4 for Rec. 709) that is designed to match the characteristics of the display.
    *   **Limited Dynamic Range:** Display-referred representations have a limited dynamic range, corresponding to the capabilities of the display device.
    *   **Specific Color Gamut:** Display-referred images are typically encoded with a color gamut that matches the display device (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3).
    *   **Directly Viewable:** Display-referred images are intended for direct viewing on the target display.
    * **Examples:**
        *   Rec. 709 video with a gamma of 2.4
        *   sRGB images
        *   DCI-P3 images for digital cinema

* **Analogy:** A display-referred image is like a print from a film negative. It's a representation of the scene that has been optimized for viewing on a specific output device.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Feature             | Scene-Referred                                                                  | Display-Referred                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Represents**      | Light levels of the original scene                                              | Light levels to be displayed on a specific device                                  |
| **Encoding**        | Typically linear or logarithmic (designed for wide dynamic range capture)       | Non-linear (designed to match the display's characteristics)                       |
| **Dynamic Range**   | Wide (can exceed the capabilities of any display)                               | Limited (matches the display's capabilities)                                       |
| **Color Gamut**     | Wide (often camera native or a very wide gamut like ACES2065-1)                 | Specific to the display device (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3)                             |
| **Directly Viewable?** | No (requires a display rendering transform)                                    | Yes                                                                                |

## Workflow Implications

*   **Color Grading:** Color grading is typically performed in a scene-referred or intermediate working space. This allows the colorist to work with the full dynamic range and color gamut of the captured image, before it's mapped to a specific display.
*   **ACES:** ACES is a scene-referred workflow. The core ACES color space (ACES2065-1) is scene-referred, and the Output Device Transforms (ODTs) perform the display rendering.
*   **Display Rendering:** The process of converting a scene-referred image to a display-referred image is called *display rendering*. This involves applying a transfer function (gamma or other encoding) and mapping the color gamut to the target display. This is often done using LUTs.
* **Flexibility:** Working in a scene-referred space provides more flexibility for adapting the content to different displays and delivery formats.

Understanding the difference between scene-referred and display-referred representations is fundamental to color management. It helps you to choose the right tools and workflows for your projects and to ensure that your images are displayed correctly on different devices.
