# 5.3 Integrating ACES

Integrating ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) into your workflow involves several steps, both on set and in post-production.

## On-Set

*   **Camera Selection:** Choose cameras that have well-defined ACES Input Device Transforms (IDTs). Most professional digital cinema cameras (ARRI, Sony, RED, Canon, etc.) have IDTs available.
*   **Recording Format:** Decide whether to record in RAW or Log. While ACES works with both, RAW provides the greatest flexibility. If shooting Log, use the camera manufacturer's recommended Log encoding and color gamut for ACES (e.g., ARRI Log C/ARRI Wide Gamut, Sony S-Log3/S-Gamut3.Cine, REDWideGamutRGB/Log3G10).
*   **Exposure:** Follow best practices for exposing Log or RAW footage (see section 3.3). Avoid clipping highlights, as this information will be lost even in ACES.
*   **On-Set Monitoring:** Use monitors that are capable of displaying ACES-transformed footage. This typically involves loading an appropriate Output Device Transform (ODT) into the monitor or using a LUT box (like a Teradek COLR or a Flanders Scientific BoxIO) to apply the transform. The ODT should match the intended display (e.g., Rec.709). This allows the cinematographer and director to see an image that is closer to the final graded look, rather than viewing the flat Log image.
*   **Metadata:** Ensure that all relevant metadata (camera model, recording format, lens information, etc.) is properly recorded. This metadata is important for applying the correct IDT in post-production.
* **Color Chart:** Shooting a color chart under controlled lighting conditions can be helpful for verifying color accuracy and creating custom LUTs if needed.

## Post-Production

*   **Software Support:** Use software that supports ACES. Most professional color grading and visual effects software (DaVinci Resolve, Baselight, Nuke, Flame, etc.) have built-in ACES support.
*   **Project Setup:**
    *   **DaVinci Resolve:** In Project Settings > Color Management, set the Color Science to "ACEScct" or "ACEScc". Choose the appropriate ACES version (e.g., 1.3). Set the ACES Input Transform to "No Input Transform" (you'll apply the IDTs individually to each clip). Set the ACES Output Transform to match your target display (e.g., Rec.709).
    *   **Other Software:** Consult the software's documentation for specific instructions on setting up ACES projects.
*   **Applying IDTs:** Apply the correct IDT to each clip in your project. This converts the camera-native footage to the ACES2065-1 color space. In Resolve, you can apply the IDT in the Media Pool (right-click on a clip > ACES Input Transform) or in the Color page (using the Color Space Transform effect).
*   **Working Color Space (Optional):** If you're working with visual effects, you may want to convert the footage to ACEScg (a linear color space designed for rendering and compositing). For color grading, ACEScct is generally preferred.
*   **Color Grading:** Perform color grading in ACEScct (or your chosen working color space). Because ACEScct is a logarithmic color space, it provides a familiar grading experience for colorists.
*   **Visual Effects:** If visual effects are involved, they should ideally be rendered in ACEScg. This ensures that the visual effects elements are properly integrated with the live-action footage.
*   **Output Transform:** Apply the appropriate ODT for your final deliverable. This converts the footage from the ACES color space (or your working color space) to the target display color space (e.g., Rec.709 for broadcast, DCI-P3 for cinema). In Resolve, the Output Transform is typically set in the Project Settings, but you can also apply it on a per-clip or per-timeline basis.
*   **Rendering:** Render your final output in the appropriate format and color space for your delivery requirements.

## Example Workflow (DaVinci Resolve)

1.  Create a new project in DaVinci Resolve.
2.  In Project Settings > Color Management:
    *   Set Color Science to ACEScct (or ACEScc).
    *   Choose the ACES version.
    *   Set ACES Input Transform to No Input Transform.
    *   Set ACES Output Transform to Rec.709 (or your target display).
3.  Import your footage into the Media Pool.
4.  For each clip in the Media Pool, right-click and select ACES Input Transform. Choose the correct IDT for the camera and recording format (e.g., ARRI > Log C > ARRI ALEXA).
5.  Create a timeline and add your clips.
6.  Perform color grading on the Color page.
7.  Render your final output, ensuring that the output color space matches your delivery requirements.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate ACES into your workflow, ensuring color consistency and accuracy throughout your project.
