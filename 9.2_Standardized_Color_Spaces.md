# 9.2 Standardized Color Spaces (Rec. 709, P3, Rec. 2020)

Standardized color spaces are crucial for ensuring consistent color reproduction across different devices and workflows. They define the specific characteristics of a color space, including its primaries (the specific red, green, and blue colors that define the gamut), white point, and transfer function (gamma or other encoding). This section covers the most important standardized color spaces in video production and distribution: Rec. 709, DCI-P3, and Rec. 2020.

## Rec. 709 (ITU-R BT.709)

*   **Definition:** Rec. 709 (officially ITU-R Recommendation BT.709) is the standard color space for high-definition television (HDTV). It's the most common color space for broadcast and web video.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Primaries:** Rec. 709 defines specific chromaticity coordinates for its red, green, and blue primaries. These primaries define the *gamut* of the color space â€“ the range of colors it can reproduce. The Rec. 709 gamut is relatively small compared to wider color spaces like DCI-P3 and Rec. 2020.
    *   **White Point:** The white point of Rec. 709 is D65 (6500 Kelvin), which is a standard daylight white.
    *   **Transfer Function:** Rec. 709 specifies a non-linear transfer function (often referred to as "gamma"). The overall transfer function is close to a gamma of 2.4, but it has a linear segment near black to improve shadow detail and reduce noise. The official transfer function is defined in the BT.1886 standard.
    * **Bit Depth:** Typically 8-bit, although 10-bit is increasingly used for higher quality.

*   **Usage:** Rec. 709 is the standard for:
    *   HDTV broadcasting
    *   Blu-ray discs
    *   Most web video
    *   Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content

## DCI-P3

*   **Definition:** DCI-P3 is a wider color gamut originally developed for digital cinema projection by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). It covers a larger range of colors than Rec. 709, particularly in the greens and reds.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Primaries:** DCI-P3 has different primaries than Rec. 709, resulting in a wider gamut.
    *   **White Point:** The white point of DCI-P3 is slightly greener than D65. It's often referred to as "DCI white" or "theatre white."
    *   **Transfer Function:** DCI-P3 uses a pure power function with a gamma of 2.6.
    * **Bit Depth:** Typically 12-bit in digital cinema.

*   **Usage:**
    *   Digital cinema projection
    *   Increasingly used as a mastering and delivery format for HDR content, even for non-theatrical distribution (e.g., streaming services). Many HDR displays are capable of displaying most or all of the DCI-P3 gamut.

* **P3-D65:** A variation of DCI-P3 that uses the D65 white point (same as Rec. 709). This is often used for HDR mastering and delivery, as it's more compatible with consumer displays.

## Rec. 2020 (ITU-R BT.2020)

*   **Definition:** Rec. 2020 (officially ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020) is a very wide color gamut intended for ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV) and high dynamic range (HDR) content. It covers a significantly larger range of colors than both Rec. 709 and DCI-P3.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Primaries:** Rec. 2020 has very wide primaries, encompassing a much larger portion of the visible spectrum than Rec. 709 or DCI-P3.
    *   **White Point:** The white point of Rec. 2020 is D65.
    *   **Transfer Function:** Rec. 2020 can use either a traditional gamma curve (similar to Rec. 709) for SDR content or the PQ (Perceptual Quantizer) or HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) transfer functions for HDR content.
    * **Bit Depth:** 10-bit or 12-bit.

*   **Usage:**
    *   UHDTV broadcasting (though adoption is still limited)
    *   HDR content (often used as the container for PQ or HLG encoded video)
    *   Future-proofing: Rec. 2020 is designed to be a future-proof standard, as current display technology cannot fully reproduce its entire gamut.

## Workflow Implications

*   **Choosing the Right Color Space:** Select the appropriate color space for your project based on the intended delivery format and the capabilities of your equipment.
*   **Color Management:** Use color management techniques (e.g., LUTs, color space transforms) to ensure accurate color conversion between different color spaces.
*   **Monitoring:** Use monitors that are capable of accurately displaying the target color space.
* **Mastering and Delivery:** Master and deliver your content in the appropriate color space for the intended distribution channel.

Understanding these standardized color spaces is essential for any professional working with digital video, as they form the foundation for consistent and accurate color reproduction.
