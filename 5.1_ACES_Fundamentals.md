# 5.1 ACES Fundamentals

ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) is a comprehensive, device-independent color management and interchange system developed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It's designed to address the challenges of managing color in complex production and post-production workflows, especially those involving multiple cameras, visual effects, and different display devices.

## Key Goals of ACES

*   **Device Independence:** ACES provides a common, device-independent color space for storing and exchanging image data. This means that images encoded in ACES can be accurately displayed on any device, regardless of its specific color characteristics.
*   **Wide Gamut and Dynamic Range:** ACES uses a very wide color gamut (ACES2065-1) that encompasses virtually all visible colors. It also supports a very high dynamic range, far exceeding that of traditional video formats.
*   **Interchangeability:** ACES simplifies the exchange of image data between different facilities and software applications.
*   **Archival:** ACES is designed to be an archival format, preserving the full dynamic range and color gamut of the original captured image.
*   **Simplified Workflow:** While ACES can seem complex at first, it ultimately aims to *simplify* color management by providing a standardized framework.

## Core Components of ACES

*   **ACES2065-1 (AP0):** This is the core of the ACES system. It's a very wide-gamut, *linear* color space used for archival and interchange.  It encompasses virtually all colors visible to the human eye.  It uses a set of primaries (AP0) that are *imaginary* â€“ they lie outside the range of human vision. This allows ACES2065-1 to represent any real-world color. Because it's linear, it's not ideal for color grading directly.
*   **ACEScg (AP1):** A *linear* color space designed for computer graphics rendering and compositing. It has a smaller gamut than ACES2065-1 (but still very wide), using a set of primaries called AP1. ACEScg is often used as a working color space in visual effects pipelines.
*   **ACEScct:** A *logarithmic* color space designed specifically for color grading.  The "cct" stands for "color correction tools." ACEScct provides a more familiar and intuitive grading experience than working in linear ACES2065-1 or ACEScg. It has a "toe" similar to traditional log encodings, making it feel more natural for colorists.
*   **Input Device Transform (IDT):** An IDT converts camera-native footage (Log or RAW) into the ACES2065-1 color space. IDTs are provided by camera manufacturers and the Academy. Each camera and recording format has its own specific IDT. The IDT is the *entry point* into the ACES system.
*   **Output Device Transform (ODT):** An ODT converts from the ACES color space (typically ACEScct after grading) to a specific display or output color space (e.g., Rec.709, DCI-P3, Rec.2020). ODTs are specific to the target display device. The ODT is the *exit point* from the ACES system.
*   **Look Modification Transform (LMT):** An optional transform that can be applied *within* the ACES viewing pipeline (between the IDT and the ODT). LMTs can be used to apply creative looks or to make other adjustments to the image. LMTs are typically 3D LUTs.
* **Reference Rendering Transform (RRT):** The RRT is a *conceptual* part of the ACES system. It's a standard rendering transform that converts scene-referred ACES2065-1 data to display-referred data. The RRT is not a single LUT; it's a set of principles and guidelines for how to render ACES images. The RRT is effectively built into the ODTs.

## ACES Workflow

A typical ACES workflow looks like this:

1.  **Capture:** Footage is captured using a digital cinema camera (in Log or RAW format).
2.  **Input:** The footage is brought into the ACES system by applying the appropriate IDT. This converts the camera-native data to ACES2065-1.
3.  **Working Space (Optional):** The footage may be converted to a working color space like ACEScg (for visual effects) or ACEScct (for color grading).
4.  **Color Grading/VFX:** Color grading and visual effects work are performed in the chosen working color space.
5.  **Output:** The footage is converted from the working color space (or directly from ACES2065-1) to the final delivery color space using the appropriate ODT.

## ACES Versions

ACES has evolved over time, with different versions released. Common versions include:

*   **ACES 1.0:** The initial release of ACES.
*   **ACES 1.2:** Introduced ACEScct.
*   **ACES 1.3:** Added support for a wider range of cameras and workflows.
* **ACES 2.0:** (In development)

It's important to be aware of the ACES version you're using, as different versions may have different features and requirements.

ACES provides a robust and flexible framework for color management. By understanding its core components and workflow, you can ensure color consistency and accuracy throughout your projects.
