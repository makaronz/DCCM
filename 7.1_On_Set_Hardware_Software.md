# 7.1 Hardware and Software for On-Set Workflows & Live Grading

On-set color management and live grading have become increasingly important in modern film production. They allow the cinematographer and director to preview a look that is closer to the final graded image, ensuring creative intent is maintained throughout the production process. This requires specialized hardware and software.

## Hardware

*   **Monitors:**
    *   **On-Set Reference Monitors:** These monitors should be color-accurate and capable of displaying the target color space (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3, or even HDR). Popular choices include:
        *   **Flanders Scientific:** DM series (e.g., DM240, DM250) are widely used for on-set monitoring. XM series are used for HDR.
        *   **SmallHD:** Cine and OLED series monitors offer good color accuracy and features like built-in scopes.
        *   **TVLogic:** Offers a range of monitors suitable for on-set use.
        * **Atomos:** Sumo and Neon series.
    *   **Calibration:** On-set monitors should be regularly calibrated to ensure accuracy. This typically involves using a colorimeter and calibration software.

*   **LUT Boxes:** LUT boxes are devices that apply Look Up Tables (LUTs) to a video signal in real-time. They are essential for on-set color management, allowing you to preview the graded look on a standard monitor. Popular LUT boxes include:
    *   **Teradek COLR:** A wireless video system with built-in color management capabilities. It allows you to apply LUTs and CDLs (Color Decision Lists) to the video signal and transmit it wirelessly to multiple receivers.
    *   **Flanders Scientific BoxIO:** A versatile LUT box that supports a wide range of color spaces and formats.
    *   **AJA FS-HDR:** A real-time HDR/WCG converter and frame synchronizer that also includes LUT processing capabilities.
    * **Blackmagic Design Teranex Mini SDI to HDMI 8K HDR:** (And other converters in the Teranex Mini line)

*   **Video Routers:** Video routers are used to distribute video signals to multiple destinations on set (e.g., monitors, video village, DIT cart).
    * **Blackmagic Design Smart Videohub:** A popular choice for video routing.
    * **AJA Kumo:** Another popular video router option.

*   **DIT Cart:** A DIT (Digital Imaging Technician) cart is a mobile workstation that houses all the necessary equipment for on-set color management, data management, and quality control. A typical DIT cart might include:
    *   Monitors
    *   LUT box
    *   Video router
    *   Computer (Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, or similar)
    *   RAID storage
    *   Waveform monitor/vectorscope
    *   Power distribution
    *   Cables and accessories

*   **Waveform Monitors/Vectorscopes:** These are essential tools for monitoring the video signal and ensuring that it's within the legal range for broadcast or other delivery requirements. Some monitors have built in waveform/vectorscopes. Standalone options include:
    *   **Leader LV5600/LV7600**
    *   **Tektronix WFM series**
    *   **Blackmagic Design SmartScope Duo 4K**

* **Colorimeters:** For monitor calibration.
    * **X-Rite i1Display Pro**
    * **Klein K10-A**
    * **Photo Research SpectraScan PR-740/745/788** (Spectroradiometers - more accurate than colorimeters)

## Software

*   **Live Grading Software:**
    *   **Pomfort Livegrade Pro:** One of the most popular software applications for live grading on set. It allows you to create and apply LUTs and CDLs, control LUT boxes, and communicate color decisions with the post-production team.
    *   **Pomfort Silverstack:** A data management software that integrates with Livegrade. It allows you to back up and manage camera footage, create reports, and prepare the footage for post-production.
    *   **Assimilate Live Looks:** Another live grading software option.
    *   **Colorfront On-Set Dailies:** A comprehensive system for on-set dailies processing, including live grading capabilities.
    * **DaVinci Resolve:** While primarily a post-production tool, Resolve can also be used for live grading, especially with the addition of a control surface.

*   **Data Management Software:**
    *   **Pomfort Silverstack:** (As mentioned above)
    *   **Imagine Products ShotPut Pro:** A popular offloading and verification tool.
    *   **YoYotta:** Another data management and archiving solution.

*   **Calibration Software:**
    *   **Calman:** Widely used for monitor calibration.
    *   **LightSpace CMS:** Another popular calibration software option.
    * **SpectraCal CalMAN:** Another popular option.

* **Remote Collaboration Tools:**
    * **Streambox:** For remote viewing and collaboration.
    * **Sohonet ClearView Flex:** Another option for remote collaboration.

This combination of hardware and software allows for a robust and efficient on-set color management workflow, ensuring that the creative vision of the cinematographer and director is accurately captured and maintained throughout the production process.
