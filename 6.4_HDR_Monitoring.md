# 6.4 HDR Monitoring

Accurate monitoring is absolutely critical for working with High Dynamic Range (HDR) content. You need a display that can accurately reproduce the wider dynamic range and color gamut of HDR, and it needs to be properly calibrated. Without accurate monitoring, you can't make informed decisions about color grading, exposure, or any other aspect of the image.

## Requirements for HDR Monitoring

*   **High Peak Brightness:** HDR displays need to be capable of achieving much higher peak brightness levels than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) displays. The specific requirements vary depending on the HDR standard, but generally, a minimum of 1000 nits peak brightness is recommended for professional HDR mastering. Some displays can go much higher (e.g., 4000 nits or more).
*   **Low Black Level:**  Just as important as high brightness is a low black level. HDR displays need to be able to display very dark blacks, to achieve a high contrast ratio.
*   **Wide Color Gamut:** HDR displays need to be able to reproduce a wider range of colors than SDR displays. The target color gamut is typically Rec. 2020 or DCI-P3.
*   **Support for HDR Transfer Functions:** The display needs to support the relevant HDR transfer functions (PQ and/or HLG).
*   **Calibration:**  The display must be properly calibrated to ensure accurate color and luminance reproduction. This typically involves using a colorimeter and specialized calibration software.
* **Bit Depth:** The monitor should support at least 10-bit color depth to avoid banding.

## Types of HDR Monitors

*   **Professional Mastering Monitors:** These are high-end displays designed specifically for professional color grading and mastering. They typically offer the highest accuracy, widest color gamut, and highest peak brightness. Examples include:
    *   Sony BVM-HX310
    *   Canon DP-V3120
    *   Flanders Scientific XM311K
    *   Dolby PRM-4220

*   **Prosumer/Client Review Monitors:** These displays offer a good balance of performance and price, making them suitable for client review or for less critical monitoring applications. Examples include:
    *   LG UltraFine OLED Pro
    *   ASUS ProArt PA32UCG
    *   Apple Pro Display XDR

*   **Consumer HDR TVs:** While consumer HDR TVs can be used for a general idea of how the content will look, they are *not* suitable for critical color grading or mastering. They often lack the accuracy, consistency, and calibration options of professional displays. They can, however, be useful for final QC checks.

## Calibration

Calibration is essential for accurate HDR monitoring. The process typically involves:

1.  **Warm-up:** Allow the display to warm up for a sufficient amount of time (typically 30-60 minutes) before calibration.
2.  **Colorimeter:** Use a high-quality colorimeter (e.g., a Klein K10-A, a X-Rite i1Display Pro, or a similar device) to measure the display's output.
3.  **Calibration Software:** Use specialized calibration software (e.g., Calman, LightSpace, or the display manufacturer's own software) to guide the calibration process.
4.  **Targets:** Calibrate the display to the appropriate targets for the HDR standard you're working with (e.g., Rec. 2020, DCI-P3, PQ, HLG).
5.  **Verification:** After calibration, verify the results using test patterns and real-world content.

## On-Set HDR Monitoring

On-set HDR monitoring presents additional challenges, as you often need a display that is both accurate and rugged enough to withstand the rigors of a production environment.

*   **LUT Boxes:** LUT boxes (like the Teradek COLR, Flanders Scientific BoxIO, or AJA FS-HDR) can be used to apply HDR transforms to the camera output, allowing you to view an HDR image on a standard monitor. However, this is not a substitute for a true HDR display.
*   **HDR-Capable Field Monitors:** Some field monitors (e.g., from SmallHD, Atomos, or Convergent Design) offer HDR capabilities. These monitors are typically not as accurate as professional mastering monitors, but they can provide a useful preview of the HDR image on set.
* **Waveform Monitors and Scopes:** Utilize waveform monitors and other scopes that are HDR-aware to help judge exposure and ensure you are within the bounds of your chosen HDR format.

## Workflow Considerations

*   **Consistent Monitoring:** Use the same calibrated HDR monitor throughout the entire post-production process, from color grading to final QC.
*   **Viewing Environment:** The viewing environment is also important. Ideally, you should grade HDR content in a dimly lit room with neutral-colored walls.
* **Multiple Displays:** If possible, have access to both a professional mastering monitor and a consumer HDR TV for quality control. This will help you to ensure that your content looks good on a variety of displays.

Accurate HDR monitoring is a complex but essential part of any HDR workflow. By investing in the right equipment and following best practices, you can ensure that you're seeing the true colors and dynamic range of your HDR content.
