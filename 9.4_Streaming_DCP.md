# 9.4 Streaming Platforms and DCP

This section covers the color management and technical requirements for delivering content to streaming platforms and for creating Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) for theatrical distribution. These two distribution channels have very different requirements.

## Streaming Platforms (Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, etc.)

Streaming platforms have become a major distribution channel for film and television content. Each platform has its own specific technical requirements, but there are some common themes.

*   **Color Space:**
    *   **SDR:** Most platforms require content to be delivered in Rec. 709 with a gamma of 2.4 (or BT.1886).
    *   **HDR:**  Platforms increasingly support HDR content, typically requiring delivery in one or more of the following formats:
        *   **HDR10:** PQ transfer function, Rec. 2020 color gamut, static metadata.
        *   **Dolby Vision:** PQ transfer function, Rec. 2020 color gamut, dynamic metadata.
        *   **HDR10+:** PQ transfer function, Rec. 2020 color gamut, dynamic metadata.
        *   **HLG:** Hybrid Log-Gamma transfer function, Rec. 2020 color gamut.

*   **Codecs and Container Formats:**
    *   **IMF (Interoperable Master Format):**  Many platforms require or recommend delivery in the IMF format (SMPTE ST 2067). IMF is a standardized, file-based format for storing and exchanging multiple versions of a finished program. It's designed to simplify the distribution of content to different platforms and territories. An IMF package contains the video essence (typically in JPEG 2000 format), audio essence, subtitles, and metadata.
    *   **ProRes:** Apple ProRes is often accepted as a mezzanine format.
    *   **H.264/H.265:** These are common delivery codecs for streaming platforms.
    * **Container formats:** MOV, MP4, MXF (for IMF)

*   **Bit Depth:**
    *   **SDR:** 8-bit or 10-bit.
    *   **HDR:** 10-bit or higher.

*   **Chroma Subsampling:** 4:2:0 is common for delivery, but 4:2:2 may be required for mezzanine or IMF packages.

*   **Data Rates:** Platforms typically specify minimum and maximum data rates for different resolutions and frame rates.

*   **Metadata:** HDR content requires metadata to describe the mastering display characteristics and to help the display device tone map the content correctly. HDR10 uses static metadata (SMPTE ST 2086), while Dolby Vision and HDR10+ use dynamic metadata (SMPTE ST 2094).

*   **Quality Control (QC):**  Streaming platforms have strict QC requirements. Content must be checked for technical errors, artifacts, and compliance with the platform's specifications.

* **Specific Platform Requirements:** It's essential to consult the specific technical specifications of each streaming platform you're delivering to. These specifications can change, so always refer to the latest documentation. Netflix, for example, has very detailed documentation on its partner portal.

## Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs)

A DCP (Digital Cinema Package) is the standard format for distributing films to digital cinemas. It's a collection of files that includes the video, audio, subtitles, and metadata, all packaged in a specific way.

*   **Color Space:**
    *   **XYZ:** DCPs use the CIE XYZ color space. This is a device-independent color space that is different from the RGB color spaces used for most video formats. The XYZ values are *not* directly related to display primaries.
    *   **Conversion from RGB to XYZ:** The video data must be converted from its original color space (e.g., Rec. 709, DCI-P3, Rec. 2020) to XYZ for inclusion in the DCP. This conversion is typically performed using a 3x3 matrix transformation.
    * **DCI-P3 (within XYZ container):** While the *container* is XYZ, the color primaries used within that container are typically those of DCI-P3.

*   **Codec:**
    *   **JPEG 2000:** The standard video codec for DCPs is JPEG 2000 (J2K). JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based compression algorithm that offers good image quality and supports both lossy and lossless compression. DCPs typically use lossy JPEG 2000 compression.
    * **Bit Depth:** 12-bit.

*   **Frame Rates:** DCPs support various frame rates, including 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, and 60 frames per second. High Frame Rate (HFR) DCPs can support even higher frame rates (e.g., 120 fps).

*   **Resolution:**
    *   **2K:** 2048 x 1080 (full container), with various aspect ratios within that (e.g., 1998 x 1080 for "flat" 1.85:1, 2048 x 858 for "scope" 2.39:1).
    *   **4K:** 4096 x 2160 (full container), with various aspect ratios within that (e.g., 3996 x 2160 for "flat" 1.85:1, 4096 x 1716 for "scope" 2.39:1).

*   **Audio:** DCPs typically use uncompressed 24-bit linear PCM audio.

*   **Subtitles:** DCPs support various subtitle formats, including XML-based subtitles.

*   **File Structure:** A DCP has a specific file structure, with separate files for the video, audio, subtitles, and metadata. The files are typically named according to a standardized naming convention.

*   **Encryption:** DCPs can be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption requires the generation and distribution of Key Delivery Messages (KDMs) to the cinema's playback server.

*   **DCP Creation Software:** Specialized software is required to create DCPs (e.g., easyDCP, OpenDCP, Fraunhofer easyDCP, QubeMaster Pro).

* **Testing:** It's essential to test DCPs thoroughly before distribution to ensure that they play back correctly on digital cinema systems.

Delivering content to streaming platforms and creating DCPs require careful attention to technical specifications and quality control. Understanding the specific requirements of each distribution channel is crucial for ensuring that your content is displayed correctly and reaches its intended audience.
