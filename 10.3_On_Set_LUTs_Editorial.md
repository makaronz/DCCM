# 10.3 Using On-Set LUTs in Editorial

On-set LUTs (Look Up Tables) and CDLs (Color Decision Lists) are created during production to preview a specific look and ensure consistency between the set and the editing room. Properly utilizing these on-set looks in editorial is crucial for maintaining the creative intent and streamlining the post-production workflow.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Receive LUTs/CDLs from Set:** The DIT (Digital Imaging Technician) or on-set colorist will typically provide the LUTs and CDLs, along with any relevant notes about their application (e.g., which LUT was used for which scene or shot). Common LUT formats include .cube, .3dl. CDLs are often provided as .cdl files or embedded within an EDL (Edit Decision List).

2.  **Organize LUTs/CDLs:** Create a well-organized folder structure for your LUTs and CDLs. This will make it easier to find the correct LUT for each clip. A good practice is to name the LUTs descriptively, including information about the project, scene, shot, and any specific adjustments made.

3.  **Import Footage into Editing Software:** Import the camera original footage into your editing software (e.g., Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro).

4.  **Apply LUTs/CDLs:** There are several ways to apply LUTs and CDLs in editorial, depending on the software:

    *   **Avid Media Composer:**
        *   **Source Settings:** You can apply a LUT to the source clips in the Source Settings. This is a non-destructive way to apply the LUT.
        *   **Color Correction Effect:** You can apply a LUT using the Color Correction effect.
        * **Importing CDLs:** Media Composer can import CDLs and apply them as color corrections.

    *   **Adobe Premiere Pro:**
        *   **Lumetri Color Panel:** You can apply a LUT using the "Input LUT" or "Creative Look" dropdown menus in the Lumetri Color panel.
        * **Importing CDLs:** Premiere Pro can import CDLs.

    *   **DaVinci Resolve:**
        *   **Media Pool:** You can apply a LUT to clips in the Media Pool by right-clicking and selecting "3D LUT."
        *   **Color Page:** You can apply LUTs and CDLs as nodes in the Color page. Resolve has a dedicated node for CDLs.
        * **Project Settings:** You can set a project-wide 3D LUT, but this is generally *not* recommended for on-set LUTs, as you'll likely need to apply different LUTs to different clips.

    *   **Final Cut Pro:**
        *   **Custom LUT Effect:** You can apply a LUT using the "Custom LUT" effect.

5.  **Evaluate the Look:** View the footage with the LUT/CDL applied and evaluate whether it matches the intended look from the set.

6.  **Adjust as Needed:**  The on-set LUT/CDL is a *starting point*, not the final grade. You may need to make minor adjustments to the LUT/CDL in editorial to account for differences in monitors or to fine-tune the look. However, avoid making drastic changes that deviate significantly from the on-set look without consulting with the cinematographer or director.

7.  **Communication with Colorist:**  Maintain clear communication with the colorist who will be performing the final grade. Provide them with the on-set LUTs/CDLs and any notes about their application. This will ensure that the colorist understands the creative intent and can build upon the on-set look.

8. **Offline vs. Online:** If you're working with proxy files for offline editing, you'll typically apply the LUT/CDL to the proxy files. When you conform the online edit using the original camera files, the LUT/CDL will need to be re-applied (or linked) to the high-resolution footage.

## Best Practices

*   **Non-Destructive Application:** Apply LUTs/CDLs non-destructively. This means that the original footage should remain unchanged, and the LUT/CDL should be applied as a separate effect or metadata.
*   **Consistency:** Use the same LUTs/CDLs that were used on set. Avoid using different LUTs or making significant adjustments without consulting with the cinematographer or director.
*   **Metadata:** Ensure that the LUT/CDL information is properly tracked in the metadata. This will make it easier to manage the LUTs/CDLs and to communicate with the post-production team.
* **Color-Managed Workflow:** Use a color-managed workflow (e.g., ACES or a camera-native workflow with proper color space management) to ensure accurate color reproduction throughout the post-production process.
* **Monitor Calibration:** Use a calibrated monitor in the editing room to ensure that you're seeing an accurate representation of the image.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively utilize on-set LUTs and CDLs in editorial, maintaining color consistency and streamlining the post-production workflow.
