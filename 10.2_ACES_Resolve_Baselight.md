# 10.2 ACES in Resolve and Baselight

This section provides a guide to setting up and using ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) in two popular color grading applications: DaVinci Resolve and FilmLight Baselight.

## DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci Resolve offers robust support for ACES, making it relatively straightforward to implement an ACES workflow.

**Project Setup:**

1.  **Open Project Settings:** Go to File > Project Settings (or Shift+9).
2.  **Color Management:** Navigate to the "Color Management" tab.
3.  **Color Science:** From the "Color science" dropdown menu, choose one of the ACES options:
    *   **ACEScc:**  Uses ACEScc as the working color space (logarithmic encoding, suitable for grading).
    *   **ACEScct:** Uses ACEScct as the working color space (logarithmic encoding with a "toe" similar to traditional log curves, often preferred by colorists).
    *   **ACEScg:** Uses ACEScg as the working color space (linear encoding, suitable for visual effects and compositing).  Generally, you'll use ACEScc or ACEScct for color grading.

4.  **ACES Version:** Select the desired ACES version (e.g., 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0.3).  It's generally recommended to use the latest version unless you have a specific reason to use an older one.
5.  **ACES Input Transform:** Leave this set to "No Input Transform." You will apply the Input Device Transforms (IDTs) to individual clips in the Media Pool or on the Color page. This gives you more control and flexibility.
6.  **ACES Output Transform:** Select the appropriate Output Device Transform (ODT) for your target display. For example:
    *   **Rec.709:** For standard dynamic range (SDR) Rec. 709 displays.
    *   **P3-D65 (DCI):**  For DCI-P3 displays with a D65 white point.
    *   **Rec.2020:** For Rec. 2020 displays.
    *   **HDR formats (PQ/HLG):** Choose the appropriate ODT for your target HDR standard (e.g., Rec.2020 ST2084 (PQ) 1000 nits).

**Applying IDTs:**

There are two main ways to apply IDTs in Resolve:

*   **Media Pool:**
    1.  Select the clips in the Media Pool.
    2.  Right-click and choose "ACES Input Transform."
    3.  Select the appropriate IDT for your camera and recording format (e.g., ARRI > Log C > ARRI ALEXA, Sony > S-Log3 > S-Gamut3.Cine, RED > REDWideGamutRGB > Log3G10).

*   **Color Page (Color Space Transform):**
    1.  Add a "Color Space Transform" node to your node tree.
    2.  In the "Input Color Space" and "Input Gamma" fields, select the appropriate settings for your camera and recording format.
    3.  In the "Output Color Space" and "Output Gamma" fields, select "ACES" and "ACEScct" (or "ACEScc" or "ACEScg", depending on your chosen working space).

**Grading in ACES:**

Once you've set up your project and applied the IDTs, you can grade in the ACEScct (or ACEScc/ACEScg) color space. Resolve's color grading tools will behave as expected, but you'll be working with the full dynamic range and color gamut of the ACES working space.

**Output:**

When you render your final output, Resolve will automatically apply the ODT you selected in the Project Settings. You can also override the ODT on a per-clip or per-timeline basis if needed.

## FilmLight Baselight

Baselight also offers comprehensive support for ACES.

**Project Setup:**

1.  **Create a New Scene:** Start a new scene in Baselight.
2.  **Scene Settings:** Go to the "Scene Settings" (typically found in the "Views" menu or with a keyboard shortcut).
3.  **Format and Color:**
    *   **Working Format:** Choose a suitable working format (e.g., UHD, 2K, 4K).
    *   **Working Colorspace:** Select the desired ACES working color space (e.g., ACEScct, ACEScc, ACEScg).
4.  **Views:**
    *   **Default View:** Set the "Default View" to the appropriate ODT for your monitor (e.g., Rec.709, P3-D65).

**Input Transforms (Truelight Colour Spaces):**

Baselight uses the term "Truelight Colour Spaces" to manage input transforms.

1.  **Import Media:** Import your footage into Baselight.
2.  **Input Color Space:** In the "Input" tab (or similar, depending on the Baselight version), select the appropriate input color space for your camera and recording format. Baselight will automatically apply the correct IDT based on your selection. You can also manually select a specific Truelight Colour Space if needed.

**Grading in ACES:**

Baselight's color grading tools will operate within the ACES working color space you selected.

**Output:**

1.  **Render:** Go to the "Render" or "Deliver" view.
2.  **Output Format:** Choose the desired output format and codec.
3.  **Output Color Space:** Select the appropriate output color space for your deliverable (e.g., Rec. 709, P3-D65, Rec. 2020). Baselight will automatically apply the correct ODT based on your selection.

**Key Differences from Resolve:**

*   **Terminology:** Baselight uses the term "Truelight Colour Spaces" instead of "Input Device Transforms" (IDTs).
*   **Input Transform Application:** Baselight typically applies the input transform automatically based on the selected input color space, whereas Resolve often requires you to apply the IDT manually.
* **Scene Settings:** Baselight's scene settings are more comprehensive, encompassing format, color space, and viewing transforms in one place.

Both DaVinci Resolve and Baselight provide robust tools for working with ACES. The specific steps and terminology may differ slightly, but the underlying principles are the same. Always consult the software's documentation for the most up-to-date information and detailed instructions.
