# 3.3 Best Practices for Exposing Log and RAW

Proper exposure is crucial for achieving optimal image quality, regardless of whether you're shooting Log or RAW. However, the techniques and considerations differ slightly between the two.

## Exposing Log

*   **Expose to the Right (ETTR):**  The general recommendation for exposing Log footage is to "expose to the right" (ETTR). This means intentionally overexposing the image slightly *without* clipping the highlights.  The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by capturing as much light as possible. Log encodings allocate more code values to the darker parts of the image, so overexposing slightly helps to lift the shadows out of the noise floor.

*   **Monitor with a LUT:**  Log footage looks "flat" and desaturated on a standard monitor.  To get an accurate representation of the final graded image, it's essential to monitor with a *display LUT* (Lookup Table).  A display LUT transforms the Log footage to a standard color space (like Rec.709) for viewing on set. This helps you to judge exposure and composition correctly, even though you're recording in Log.

*   **Use Zebras and False Color:**  Zebras and false color are exposure tools built into many cameras and monitors.
    *   **Zebras:**  Display a striped pattern over areas of the image that reach a specific brightness level.  You can set the zebra level to indicate the point where highlights are about to clip.
    *   **False Color:**  Displays different colors to represent different exposure levels. This provides a more detailed visual representation of the exposure across the entire image.

*   **Understand the Specific Log Encoding:**  Different Log encodings (Log C, S-Log3, Log3G10, etc.) have different characteristics.  It's important to understand the specific Log encoding you're using and how it affects exposure.  Consult the camera manufacturer's documentation for recommendations.

* **Middle Gray:** Knowing where middle gray (18% reflectance) falls within your chosen log format is very helpful. Many manufacturers provide this information.

## Exposing RAW

*   **Less Critical, but Still Important:**  With RAW, exposure is less critical than with Log, because you can adjust exposure (and other parameters) in post-production without significant loss of quality. However, it's *still* important to avoid clipping highlights.  Once highlights are clipped in RAW, that information is lost forever.

*   **Avoid Clipping Highlights:**  Use your camera's exposure tools (zebras, false color, waveform monitor, histogram) to ensure that you're not clipping highlights.

*   **Don't Underexpose Excessively:** While you can adjust exposure in post with RAW, excessive underexposure can still lead to increased noise in the shadows.

*   **Monitor with a LUT (Optional):**  Even though you can adjust exposure in post with RAW, it can still be helpful to monitor with a display LUT on set. This gives you a better idea of what the final image will look like and can help you make creative decisions about lighting and composition.

## General Best Practices (for Both Log and RAW)

*   **Use a Light Meter:**  A light meter provides an objective measurement of the light in the scene.  It can be used to determine the correct exposure for middle gray and to assess the overall contrast range of the scene.
*   **Understand Dynamic Range:**  Be aware of the dynamic range of your camera.  This will help you to make informed decisions about how to expose the scene and whether you need to use additional lighting or light modification tools (like reflectors or diffusers).
*   **Shoot Tests:**  Before shooting a project, it's always a good idea to shoot tests with your chosen camera, lens, and recording format.  This allows you to experiment with different exposure techniques and see how the footage looks when graded.
* **Consult with the Colorist:** If possible, consult with the colorist who will be grading the footage. They can provide valuable insights into how to expose for the best results in post-production.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that you're capturing the highest quality images possible, whether you're shooting Log or RAW.
