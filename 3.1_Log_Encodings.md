# 3.1 Mathematical Breakdown of Log Encodings

Logarithmic encodings are designed to compress a wide dynamic range of scene luminance into a smaller range of code values, suitable for digital storage and processing. They do this by mimicking the logarithmic response of human vision, allocating more code values to darker areas of the image (where we are more sensitive to changes) and fewer code values to brighter areas.

While the specific formulas vary between camera manufacturers, most log encodings share some common characteristics:

*   **A Logarithmic Curve:** The core of the encoding is a logarithmic function, which maps scene luminance to code values. The base of the logarithm can vary (e.g., base 2, base 10, or the natural logarithm base *e*).
*   **A Linear Segment (Toe):**  A linear segment is often added to the shadows (the "toe" of the curve) to control noise and provide a smooth transition to black. This helps to prevent the darkest parts of the image from becoming excessively noisy when the log curve is later expanded during grading.
*   **Gain and Offset:** Parameters like gain and offset are used to adjust the slope and position of the curve, controlling the overall brightness and contrast of the encoded image.

## Specific Examples (Illustrative - Precise Formulas Require Manufacturer Documentation)

It's important to note that the *exact* mathematical formulas for log encodings are often proprietary and are typically found in the camera manufacturer's technical documentation or white papers. However, we can illustrate the general principles with simplified examples.

*   **ARRI Log C (Simplified Example):**

    ARRI Log C is one of the most widely used log encodings in the film industry.  A highly simplified representation (not the actual formula) might look like this:

    ```
    if (x <= a) {
      y = m * x + b;  // Linear segment (toe)
    } else {
      y = c * log(x) + d; // Logarithmic segment
    }
    ```

    Where:

    *   `x` is the normalized linear scene luminance.
    *   `y` is the encoded code value.
    *   `a` is the breakpoint between the linear and logarithmic segments.
    *   `m` and `b` are the slope and offset of the linear segment.
    *   `c` and `d` are parameters that control the shape and position of the logarithmic segment.

    The actual Log C formula is more complex, involving multiple segments and carefully chosen parameters to optimize the encoding for the characteristics of ARRI's sensors.

*   **Sony S-Log3 (Simplified Example):**

    S-Log3 is similar in principle to Log C, but with a different curve shape.  A simplified representation (again, *not* the actual formula) might be:

    ```
        if (x <= a){
            y = m*x + b
        }
        else{
            y = c * log10(x + offset) + d
        }
    ```

    The parameters (`a`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `offset`) would have different values than in the Log C example, resulting in a different curve shape.

*   **RED Log3G10 (Simplified Example):**

    RED's Log3G10 uses a base-10 logarithmic curve with a gain of 10.  A simplified representation might be:

    `y = log10(x * 10) * c + d`
     Where c and d are parameters to map to the code value range.

    The "gain of 10" effectively shifts the curve to the right, providing more code values for the midtones and highlights.

## Comparing Log Curves

The differences between log encodings lie in the specific shapes of their curves, the placement of the linear segment (if any), and the parameters used to control the curve. These differences are carefully designed by each manufacturer to optimize the encoding for their specific sensors and image processing pipelines.

When comparing log curves, it's important to consider:

*   **Highlight Handling:** How much headroom is provided for highlights before clipping occurs?
*   **Shadow Detail:** How well is detail preserved in the shadows?
*   **Midtone Contrast:** How much contrast is present in the midtones?
*   **Overall "Look":**  Different log curves can have a slightly different "look" when graded, even when normalized to the same display color space.

Ultimately, the choice of log encoding often comes down to personal preference, workflow considerations, and the specific requirements of the project.  It's crucial to understand the characteristics of each log encoding and how to work with it effectively in post-production.
