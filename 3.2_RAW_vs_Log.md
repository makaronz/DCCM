# 3.2 RAW Capture vs. Log Capture

RAW and Log capture are two fundamentally different approaches to recording image data from a digital cinema camera.  They both aim to capture a wider dynamic range and provide more flexibility in post-production compared to standard video recording, but they achieve this in different ways.

## RAW Capture

*   **Definition:** RAW capture records the *unprocessed* or *minimally processed* data directly from the camera's sensor.  This means that most of the in-camera processing steps (demosaicing, white balance, noise reduction, sharpening, color space conversion) are *bypassed*.  The raw data is essentially a digital representation of the light that hit each photosite on the sensor, before any interpretation or manipulation.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Maximum Image Quality:** RAW preserves the absolute maximum amount of information from the sensor, providing the highest possible image quality.
    *   **Greatest Flexibility in Post:**  Because the data is unprocessed, you have complete control over how the image is interpreted in post-production.  You can adjust white balance, ISO, exposure, and other parameters *as if* you were changing them on set.
    *   **Large File Sizes:** RAW files are typically very large, requiring significant storage space and processing power.
    *   **Complex Workflow:**  Working with RAW footage requires specialized software and a more complex workflow.

*   **Analogy:**  RAW is like a film negative. It's the original, unprocessed capture, containing all the information needed to create the final image.

## Log Capture

*   **Definition:** Log capture records image data *after* it has been processed by the camera's image processing pipeline (including demosaicing, white balance, and some noise reduction).  However, instead of encoding the image with a standard gamma curve (like Rec.709), it uses a *logarithmic* curve.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Wide Dynamic Range:** Log encoding compresses the tonal range of the scene, preserving detail in both the highlights and shadows.
    *   **More Flexibility than Standard Video:** Log footage provides more latitude for color grading than standard video, but less flexibility than RAW.
    *   **Smaller File Sizes than RAW:** Log files are typically smaller than RAW files, making them easier to manage and store.
    *   **Simpler Workflow than RAW:**  Log footage can be viewed and edited directly in most non-linear editing (NLE) software, although it requires color grading to look its best.

*   **Analogy:** Log is like a "flat" scan of a film negative. It's not the raw negative itself, but it's a high-quality representation that preserves a lot of the original information.

| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processing**   | Unprocessed or minimally processed sensor data | Processed data with logarithmic encoding        |
| **Image Quality** | Maximum                                       | High (but less than RAW)                         |
| **Flexibility**  | Maximum                                       | High (but less than RAW)                         |
| **File Size**    | Very Large                                    | Smaller than RAW, larger than standard video     |
| **Workflow**     | Complex                                       | Simpler than RAW, more complex than standard video |
| **White Balance** | Adjustable in post                            | "Baked-in" (but can be adjusted to some extent) |
| **ISO**          | Adjustable in post                            | "Baked-in" (but can be adjusted to some extent) |
| **Demosaicing**  | Performed in post                             | Performed in-camera                              |

## When to Use Which

*   **Use RAW when:**
    *   Maximum image quality and flexibility are paramount (e.g., feature films, visual effects-heavy productions).
    *   You need to make significant adjustments to the image in post-production (e.g., changing white balance or exposure).
    *   You have the storage space and processing power to handle the large files.

*   **Use Log when:**
    *   You need a wider dynamic range and more flexibility than standard video, but don't need the absolute maximum quality of RAW.
    *   You want a simpler workflow and smaller file sizes than RAW.
    *   You're shooting for a project that will be graded, but doesn't require extensive visual effects work.

In some cases, productions may use a combination of RAW and Log. For example, they might shoot RAW for scenes with complex visual effects and Log for scenes that are less demanding. The best choice always depends on the specific needs and constraints of the project.
